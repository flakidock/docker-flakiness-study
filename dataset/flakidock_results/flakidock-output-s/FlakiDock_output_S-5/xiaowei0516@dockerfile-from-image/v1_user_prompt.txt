Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM alpine

RUN  apk add --update python3 wget \
     && wget --no-check-certificate https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py \
     && apk del wget \
     && python3 get-pip.py \
     && rm get-pip.py \
     && pip3 install -U docker-py pip \
     && yes | pip uninstall pip

COPY entrypoint.py /root

ENTRYPOINT ["/root/entrypoint.py"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
