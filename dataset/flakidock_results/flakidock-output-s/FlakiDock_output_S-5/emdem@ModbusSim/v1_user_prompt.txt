Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add --no-cache python3 && \
  python3 -m ensurepip && \
  rm -r /usr/lib/python*/ensurepip && \
  pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools && \
  rm -r /root/.cache

RUN mkdir -p /opt
ADD requirements.txt /opt/.
RUN pip3 install -r /opt/requirements.txt
RUN rm /opt/requirements.txt
ADD . /opt/
CMD ["python3", "-u", "/opt/src/server.py"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
