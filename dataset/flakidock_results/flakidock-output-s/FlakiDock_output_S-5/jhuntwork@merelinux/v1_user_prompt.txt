Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM mere/base as build

ENV BL_VRS=2.0.5-1
ENV BB_VRS=1.33.1-5
ENV PM_VRS=6.0.1-3
ENV CA_VRS=7.79.0-2

RUN install -d /tmp/system/var/lib/pacman
RUN pacman -r /tmp/system -Sy \
        base-layout=${BL_VRS} busybox=${BB_VRS} pacman=${PM_VRS} ca-certs=${CA_VRS} --noconfirm
RUN rm /tmp/system/etc/services \
       /tmp/system/etc/protocols \
       /tmp/system/etc/pacman.conf.example \
       /tmp/system/usr/bin/pacman-conf

FROM scratch

COPY --from=build /tmp/system /

CMD ["/bin/sh"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
