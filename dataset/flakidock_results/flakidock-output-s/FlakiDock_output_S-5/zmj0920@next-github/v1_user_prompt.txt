Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM mhart/alpine-node:9

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

RUN rm -f package-lock.json \
    ; rm -rf .idea \
    ; rm -rf node_modules \
    ; npm config set registry "https://registry.npm.taobao.org/" \
    && npm install

EXPOSE 3001
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
