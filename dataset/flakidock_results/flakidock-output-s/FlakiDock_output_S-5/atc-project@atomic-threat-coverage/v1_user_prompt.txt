Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM alpine
COPY ./ /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN apk update; \
    apk add --update \
    python3 \
    python3-dev \
    py-pip \
    gcc \
    musl-dev \
    bash;

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt;
    
RUN apk del python3-dev \
    gcc \
    musl-dev;

RUN rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* ; \
    rm -rf Atomic_Threat_Coverage;

CMD /app/docker-entrypoint.sh


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
