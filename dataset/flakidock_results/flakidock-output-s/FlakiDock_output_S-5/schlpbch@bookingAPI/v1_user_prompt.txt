Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:7-onbuild

ARG BUILD_DATE="`date`"

LABEL org.label-schema.vendor="SBB" \
      org.label-schema.url="https://www.sbb.ch" \
      org.label-schema.name="bookingAPI" \
      org.label-schema.description="A simple API to book tickets for public transport in Switzerland." \
      org.label-schema.vcs-url="https://github.com/schlpbch/bookingAPI" \
      org.label-schema.build-date=$BUILD_DATE

# Fix permissions for runtime
RUN chmod -R 777 ./public/app

CMD npm run dev

EXPOSE 8080


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
