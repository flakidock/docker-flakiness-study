Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:4.2.2

# Install location
ENV dir /opt/ldf-client

# Copy the client files
ADD . ${dir}

# Install the node module
RUN cd ${dir} && npm install

# Run base binary
WORKDIR ${dir}
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "bin/ldf-client"]

# Default command
CMD ["--help"]



Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
