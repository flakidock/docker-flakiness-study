Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:4.4

WORKDIR /watchmen

# Installs dependencies first
ADD package.json bower.json .bowerrc /watchmen/
RUN set -x \
 && npm install -g bower \
 && npm install \
 && bower install --allow-root

# Add all the project
ADD . /watchmen

ENV WATCHMEN_WEB_PORT=3000

EXPOSE 3000


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
