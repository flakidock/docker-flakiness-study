Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM minio/minio:latest

# Add user dokku with an individual UID
RUN adduser -u 32769 -m -U dokku
USER dokku

# Create data directory for the user, where we will keep the data
RUN mkdir -p /home/dokku/data

# Add custom nginx.conf template for Dokku to use
WORKDIR /app
ADD nginx.conf.sigil .

CMD ["minio", "server", "/home/dokku/data", "--console-address", ":9001"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
