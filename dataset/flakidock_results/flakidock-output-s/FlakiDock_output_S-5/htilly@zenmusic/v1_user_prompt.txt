Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:17-alpine as intermediate
LABEL stage=intermediate

RUN apk update && \
    apk upgrade && \
    apk add git && \
    git clone https://github.com/htilly/zenmusic.git

FROM node:17-alpine
RUN mkdir app
COPY --from=intermediate /zenmusic/* /app/
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install

CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
