Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
MAINTAINER Roman Dodin <dodin.roman@gmail.com>
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 && \
    python3 -m ensurepip && \
    rm -r /usr/lib/python*/ensurepip && \
    pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools && \
    rm -r /root/.cache
COPY ./web_app/requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -qr /tmp/requirements.txt
RUN mkdir -p /opt/webapp
COPY ./web_app /opt/webapp/
WORKDIR /opt/webapp
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
