Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.6.1

# Install Node.js
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install the gems
ADD Gemfile Gemfile.lock .ruby-version /app/
WORKDIR /app
RUN bundle install

# Mount the app
VOLUME /app

# Start the app
EXPOSE 4567
CMD bundle exec middleman


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
