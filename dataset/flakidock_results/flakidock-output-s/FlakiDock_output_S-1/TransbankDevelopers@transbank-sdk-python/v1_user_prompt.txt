Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7.4-stretch
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-pip
RUN pip install pipenv
RUN mkdir -p /sdk
WORKDIR /sdk
COPY . /sdk


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
