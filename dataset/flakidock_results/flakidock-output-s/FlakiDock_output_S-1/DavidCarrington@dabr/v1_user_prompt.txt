Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM php:5.6-apache

RUN a2enmod rewrite

RUN echo "date.timezone = Europe/London" > /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/timezone.ini

# mcrypt
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libmcrypt-dev
RUN docker-php-ext-install mcrypt


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
