Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:8.12-alpine as builder
RUN apk add g++ make python
WORKDIR '/app'
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm i node-sass --sass_binary_site=https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/node-sass/
RUN npm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org install
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build:prod

FROM nginx
EXPOSE 9527
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html/


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
