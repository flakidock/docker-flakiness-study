Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.8

RUN apk update \
    && apk add python py-pip rsyslog rsyslog-tls ca-certificates openssl \
    && pip install awscli

COPY run.py /run.py
COPY crontab.txt /crontab.txt
COPY crontab-syslog.txt /crontab-syslog.txt
COPY rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.conf
COPY entry.sh /entry.sh

RUN chmod 755 /entry.sh

CMD ["/entry.sh"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
