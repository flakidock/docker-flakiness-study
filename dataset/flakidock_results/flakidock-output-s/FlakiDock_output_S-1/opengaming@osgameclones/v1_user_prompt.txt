Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM alpine AS builder

RUN mkdir /src /app
WORKDIR /src
COPY . /src/
COPY CHECKS /app/CHECKS

RUN apk add --no-cache curl make gcc musl-dev libffi-dev python3 python3-dev
RUN env
RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_HOME=/etc/poetry python3 -

ENV PATH /etc/poetry/bin/:$PATH

RUN poetry install
RUN make run 

FROM nginx:1.17-alpine

COPY --from=builder /src/_build /www
COPY vhost.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
COPY CHECKS /app/CHECKS
EXPOSE 80


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
