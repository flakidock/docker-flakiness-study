Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM maddinat0r/debian-samp

RUN apt update && apt install -y uuid-dev:i386 curl
RUN curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Southclaws/sampctl/master/install-bin.sh | sh && cp sampctl /usr/bin/sampctl
ADD . .
RUN mkdir build
ENTRYPOINT [ "make", "build-inside" ]

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
