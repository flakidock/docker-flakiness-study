Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:10

MAINTAINER Daniel Espendiller <daniel@espendiller.net>

# Install build-essential, sqlite in order
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    sqlite \
&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
COPY package.json /usr/src/app/
RUN npm install --production && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Bundle app source
COPY . /usr/src/app

# Apply all patches in app
RUN npm run postinstall

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
