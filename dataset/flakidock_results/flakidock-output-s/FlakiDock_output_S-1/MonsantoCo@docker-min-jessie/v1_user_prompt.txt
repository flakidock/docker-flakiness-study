Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
# Create an up to date minimal Debian Jessi build

# Pull base image
FROM debian:jessie

# Update packages
RUN apt-get update && \
  apt-get upgrade -y && \
  apt-get clean -y && \
  apt-get autoclean -y && \
  apt-get autoremove -y && \
  rm -rf /usr/share/locale/* && \
  rm -rf /var/cache/debconf/*-old && \
  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && \
  rm -rf /usr/share/doc/*


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
