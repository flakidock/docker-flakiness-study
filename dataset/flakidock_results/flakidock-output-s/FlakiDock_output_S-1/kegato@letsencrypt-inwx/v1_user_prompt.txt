Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ekidd/rust-musl-builder:stable as builder
COPY . .
RUN cargo install cargo-deb
RUN cargo deb --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

FROM certbot/certbot:latest
VOLUME /etc/letsencrypt
COPY --from=builder /home/rust/src/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/letsencrypt-inwx /usr/bin/
COPY etc/* /usr/lib/letsencrypt-inwx/
RUN chmod +x /usr/lib/letsencrypt-inwx/*

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/lib/letsencrypt-inwx/docker-entrypoint.sh"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
