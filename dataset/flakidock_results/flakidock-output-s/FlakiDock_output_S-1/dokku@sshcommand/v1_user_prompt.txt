Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.20.1-buster

# hadolint ignore=DL3027
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt install apt-transport-https build-essential curl gnupg2 jq lintian rsync rubygems-integration ruby-dev ruby software-properties-common sudo -qy \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# hadolint ignore=DL3028
RUN gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc --quiet rake fpm package_cloud


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
