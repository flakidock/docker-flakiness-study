Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.8.1 as build

COPY . /go/src/relevant-xkcd
WORKDIR /go/src/relevant-xkcd

RUN go get -v .
RUN go build -ldflags '-linkmode external -extldflags -static -w'

FROM alpine:3.6

COPY --from=build /go/src/relevant-xkcd/relevant-xkcd /relevant-xkcd/

WORKDIR /relevant-xkcd
ENTRYPOINT /relevant-xkcd/relevant-xkcd


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
