Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
ARG VARIANT="15"
FROM node:${VARIANT}-slim

USER root
# [Optional] Uncomment this section to install additional OS packages.
RUN apt-get update \
  && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive && apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends git sudo ca-certificates \
  && adduser node sudo \
  && echo '%sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers

USER node

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
