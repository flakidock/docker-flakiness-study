Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.7.2
LABEL maintainer="xatier <xatierlike@gmail.com>"

# prepare WORKDIR for our project
ARG dir=/srv/www/archlinux.tw
RUN mkdir -p $dir
WORKDIR $dir
COPY . $dir

# build project
RUN gem install bundler && bundle install

CMD ["/usr/local/bundle/bin/jekyll", "server", "-H", "0.0.0.0"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
