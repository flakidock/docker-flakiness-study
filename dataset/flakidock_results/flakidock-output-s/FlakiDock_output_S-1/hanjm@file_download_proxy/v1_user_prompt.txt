Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.8.4-alpine3.6
RUN apk -U add lsof git aria2
WORKDIR /go
ENV GOPATH=/go
RUN go get -v github.com/hanjm/file_download_proxy/...
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/hanjm/file_download_proxy
RUN go build -o fdp
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./fdp","-limit","100"]

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
