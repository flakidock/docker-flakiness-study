Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7
ARG WORKDIR=/code
RUN mkdir $WORKDIR
ADD ./examples/ $WORKDIR/examples
WORKDIR $WORKDIR
RUN pip install git+https://github.com/toluaina/pgsync.git
COPY ./docker/wait-for-it.sh wait-for-it.sh
COPY ./docker/runserver.sh runserver.sh
RUN chmod +x wait-for-it.sh
RUN chmod +x runserver.sh


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
