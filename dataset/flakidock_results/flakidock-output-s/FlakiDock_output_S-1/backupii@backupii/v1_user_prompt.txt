Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.6.3

## 1. Image metadata ##
 LABEL maintainer="stuart@stuartellis.name" \
    version="0.2.0" \
    description="Image for running the backup Rubygem"

## 2. Add operating system packages ##

# Dependencies for developing and running Backup
#  * The Nokogiri gem requires libxml2
#  * The unf_ext gem requires the g++ compiler to build
ENV APP_DEPS bsdtar ca-certificates curl g++ git \
    libxml2 libxslt1.1 libyaml-0-2 openssl

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends $APP_DEPS

## 3. Set working directory ##

ENV APP_HOME /usr/src/backup
WORKDIR $APP_HOME

# Update bundler to version 2
RUN gem install bundler


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
