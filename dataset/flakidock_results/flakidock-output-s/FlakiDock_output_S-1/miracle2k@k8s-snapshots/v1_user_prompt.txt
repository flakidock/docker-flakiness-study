Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-alpine

ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build_deps gcc musl-dev libffi-dev
RUN pip3 install poetry
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false
RUN poetry install --no-dev
RUN apk del .build_deps gcc musl-dev libffi-dev

ENV TZ UTC

CMD ["python", "-m", "k8s_snapshots"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
