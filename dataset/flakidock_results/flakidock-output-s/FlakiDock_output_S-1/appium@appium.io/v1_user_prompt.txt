Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:12.22.1-alpine3.11
WORKDIR '/root'
RUN apk add git python2 py-pip
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN pip install mkdocs==0.17.5
RUN npm install
VOLUME docs/ ./docs/
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "build:docs:docker"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
