Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-alpine

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install pipenv && pipenv install --dev

CMD ["pipenv", "run", "pytest"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
