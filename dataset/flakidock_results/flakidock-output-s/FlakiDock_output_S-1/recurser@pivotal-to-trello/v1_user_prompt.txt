# Prepare
RUN mkdir /app

# Install lean
RUN cd /app && bundle install --without development

WORKDIR /app
ENTRYPOINT ["bundle", "exec", "/app/bin/pivotal-to-trello"]

Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
