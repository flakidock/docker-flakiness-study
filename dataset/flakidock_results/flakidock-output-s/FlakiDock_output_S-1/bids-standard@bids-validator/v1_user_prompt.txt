Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine

COPY . /src

RUN npm install -g npm
WORKDIR /src
RUN npm install 
RUN npm -w bids-validator run build
RUN npm -w bids-validator pack
RUN npm install -g bids-validator-*.tgz

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/bids-validator"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
