Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
# Use the official Ruby image because the Rails images have been deprecated
FROM ruby:2.7.5

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgresql-client \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN mkdir /usr/local/node \
    && curl -L https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.4.7/node-v4.4.7-linux-x64.tar.xz | tar Jx -C /usr/local/node --strip-components=1
RUN ln -s ../node/bin/node /usr/local/bin/

WORKDIR /ohana-api

COPY Gemfile /ohana-api
COPY Gemfile.lock /ohana-api

RUN gem install bundler
RUN bundle install --jobs 20 --retry 5 --without production

COPY . /ohana-api

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "8080"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
