# Dockerfile
FROM node:14.3.0-alpine

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "/usr/local/bin/graphql-faker"]
WORKDIR /workdir

EXPOSE 9002

RUN yarn global add graphql-faker && \
    yarn cache clean --force

Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
