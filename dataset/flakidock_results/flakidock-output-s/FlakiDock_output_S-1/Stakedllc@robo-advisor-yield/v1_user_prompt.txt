Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
# Start with node 10.15.0
FROM node:lts-stretch-slim
RUN apt update && apt install --assume-yes git python curl dnsutils build-essential

ARG buildtime_settings=local_docker
ENV SETTINGS_ENV=$buildtime_settings

RUN mkdir /source

WORKDIR /source

COPY package.json /source/
COPY yarn.lock /source/

RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-optional --non-interactive
RUN yarn global add truffle@5.0.2

COPY . /source/

ENTRYPOINT ["/source/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["none"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
