Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/hyperledger/solang-llvm:ci as builder

COPY . src
WORKDIR /src/stdlib/
RUN make

RUN rustup default 1.64.0

WORKDIR /src
RUN cargo build --release

FROM ubuntu:20.04
COPY --from=builder /src/target/release/solang /usr/bin/solang

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="Solang Solidity Compiler" \
	org.opencontainers.image.licenses="Apache-2.0"

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/solang"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
