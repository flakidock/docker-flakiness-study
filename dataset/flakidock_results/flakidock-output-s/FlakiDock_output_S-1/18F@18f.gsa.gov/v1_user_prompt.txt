Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.7

# set locales
RUN  apt-get update >/dev/null && \
     apt-get install -y locales >/dev/null && \
     echo "en_US UTF-8" > /etc/locale.gen  && \
     locale-gen en_US.UTF-8  && \
     gem install bundler -v 1.17.1 && \
     export LANG=en_US.UTF-8  && \
     export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8  && \
     export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash - && \
apt-get install -y nodejs

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock /app/

RUN cd /app && gem install bundler && bundle install


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
