Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2-alpine

COPY Gemfile /app/
COPY Gemfile.lock /app/
RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual build-dependencies build-base && \
    gem install bundler && \
    cd /app; bundle install && \
    apk del build-dependencies build-base && \
    rm -r ~/.bundle/ /usr/local/bundle/cache
COPY src/ /app/

WORKDIR /app

CMD bundle exec rake verify_pacts


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
