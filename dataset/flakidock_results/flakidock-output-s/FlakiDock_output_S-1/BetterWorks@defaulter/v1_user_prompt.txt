Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:12

RUN apt-get update && \
  apt-get install -y \
    libcairo2 \
    libjpeg-dev \ 
    libgif-dev \
    fonts-wqy-zenhei

EXPOSE 3000

WORKDIR /app
ADD . /app

RUN npm install

COPY ./fonts/font.woff /usr/share/fonts/
RUN fc-cache -fv

CMD bin/www

Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
