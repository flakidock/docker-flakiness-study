Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.1.4
MAINTAINER Steven Jack <stevenmajack@gmail.com>

RUN mkdir -p /var/data/fake-s3 /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

RUN gem install fakes3

EXPOSE 4569

ENTRYPOINT ["fakes3", "-r" ,"/var/data/fake-s3", "-p", "4569"]



Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
