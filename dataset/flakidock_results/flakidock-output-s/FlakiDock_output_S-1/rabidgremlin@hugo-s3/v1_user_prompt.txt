Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:xenial
# Hugo install sequence based on Dockerfile from https://bitbucket.org/fmanco/docker-images

# Upgrade
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade -u && apt-get clean

# Install git and ssh client to retrieve sources
RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends openssh-client git

# Install hugo
ENV hugo_deb_url=https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.26/hugo_0.26_Linux-64bit.deb
ADD ${hugo_deb_url} /tmp/hugo.deb
RUN dpkg -i /tmp/hugo.deb && rm -f /tmp/hugo.deb

# install AWS CLI and pygments
RUN apt-get -y install python-pip && \
    pip install awscli && \
    pip install pygments

COPY hugo-s3.sh /
RUN chmod +x /hugo-s3.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/hugo-s3.sh"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
