Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:12

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install netcat, and mysql/postgres so we can create additional DBs
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -y install netcat build-essential postgresql mysql-server && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /patio
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install -g grunt-cli && \
    npm install
COPY . .

ENTRYPOINT ["./docker-entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["test"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
