Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM bhomnick/python-multi
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
RUN apt-get update -yy && apt-get install -q -y pandoc
RUN mkdir /src
WORKDIR /src
COPY requirements.txt /src/
RUN bash -lc "pip3.6 install -r requirements.txt"


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
