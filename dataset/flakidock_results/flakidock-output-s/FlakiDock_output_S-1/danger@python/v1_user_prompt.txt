Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7

LABEL maintainer="Jakub Turek <jkbturek@gmail.com>"
LABEL "com.github.actions.name"="danger-python"
LABEL "com.github.actions.description"="Runs Python Dangerfiles"
LABEL "com.github.actions.icon"="zap"
LABEL "com.github.actions.color"="blue"

# Install dependencies
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash -
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs

RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install poetry

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/danger-python
COPY . /usr/src/danger-python
RUN cd /usr/src/danger-python && \
    poetry config virtualenvs.create false && \
    poetry install --no-dev

ENTRYPOINT ["npx", "--package", "danger", "danger-python", "ci"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
