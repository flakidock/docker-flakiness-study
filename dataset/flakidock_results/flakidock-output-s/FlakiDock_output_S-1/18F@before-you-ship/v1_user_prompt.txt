Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.7

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN gem install bundler && \
  bundle install

ENV LC_ALL=C.UTF-8

CMD bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --incremental


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
