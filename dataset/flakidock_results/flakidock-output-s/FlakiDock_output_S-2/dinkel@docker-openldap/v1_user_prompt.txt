Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM debian:stretch

MAINTAINER Christian Luginb√ºhl <dinkel@pimprecords.com>

ENV OPENLDAP_VERSION 2.4.44

RUN apt-get update && \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
        slapd=${OPENLDAP_VERSION}* && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN mv /etc/ldap /etc/ldap.dist

COPY modules/ /etc/ldap.dist/modules

COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

EXPOSE 389

VOLUME ["/etc/ldap", "/var/lib/ldap"]

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

CMD ["slapd", "-d", "32768", "-u", "openldap", "-g", "openldap"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
