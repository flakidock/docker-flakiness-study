Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:boron
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json /usr/src/app/
RUN npm install
COPY . /usr/src/app

RUN apt-get update

RUN apt-get -y install openssh-client
RUN ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -N '' -f /id_rsa

RUN apt-get -y install nginx
RUN rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
COPY config/nginx/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
RUN service nginx start

EXPOSE 8090
EXPOSE 80
CMD [ "node","bin/ristretto.js"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
