Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:10-slim

RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get dist-upgrade -y \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
 && mkdir -p /app/data

COPY ./src /app/src
COPY ./migrations /app/migrations
COPY ./build /app/build
COPY package.json /app/package.json

WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install --production

VOLUME /app/config.json
VOLUME /app/data

CMD ["node", "/app/build/index.js", "/config.json"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
