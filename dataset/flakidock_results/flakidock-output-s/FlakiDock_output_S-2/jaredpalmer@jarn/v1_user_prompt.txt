Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
# Dockerfile for building Yarn.
# docker build -t yarnpkg/dev -f Dockerfile.dev .

FROM node:10

# Debian packages
RUN apt-get -y update && \
  apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    fakeroot \
    lintian \
    rpm \
    ruby \
    ruby-dev \
  && \
  apt-get clean && \
  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Ruby packages
RUN gem install fpm


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
