Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:12.6.0

LABEL maintainer "Player Squad <squad-player@dailymotion.com>"

# Configure app basedir

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install yuicompressor deps

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y java-common default-jre-headless java-wrappers libjargs-java

# Install Node deps

COPY package.json /usr/src/app
COPY package-lock.json /usr/src/app
RUN npm install

# Copy app source

COPY src /usr/src/app/src

# Run!

RUN npm run build

# Package it for later deployment, files must end up at /usr/build/sdk_js.tar.gz
RUN mkdir -p /usr/build
RUN tar -czvf /usr/build/sdk_js.tar.gz \
  -C /usr/src/app/dist .


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
