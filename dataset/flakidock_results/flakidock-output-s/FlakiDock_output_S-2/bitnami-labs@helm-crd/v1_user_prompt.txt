Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.9 as gobuild
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/bitnami-labs/helm-crd/
COPY . .
RUN make controller-static

FROM bitnami/minideb:stretch
RUN install_packages ca-certificates
COPY --from=gobuild /go/src/github.com/bitnami-labs/helm-crd/controller-static /controller
CMD ["/controller"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
