Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM debian:9.5-slim


# Update
RUN apt-get update


# Install packages
RUN apt-get -yq install rsync openssh-client


# Label
LABEL "com.github.actions.name"="rsync deployments"
LABEL "com.github.actions.description"="For deploying code to a webserver via rsync over ssh"
LABEL "com.github.actions.icon"="truck"
LABEL "com.github.actions.color"="yellow"

LABEL "repository"="http://github.com/contention/rsync-deployments"
LABEL "homepage"="https://github.com/contention/rsync-deployments"
LABEL "maintainer"="Contention <hello@contention.agency>"


# Copy entrypoint
ADD entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]



Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
