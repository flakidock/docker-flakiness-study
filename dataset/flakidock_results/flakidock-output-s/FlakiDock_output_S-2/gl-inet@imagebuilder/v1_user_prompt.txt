Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM debian:stretch-slim

RUN apt update && apt install -y \
    device-tree-compiler \
    git \
    make \
    python \
    wget

RUN if ![ -x python ]; then ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python ;fi

ENV SOURCE_DIR="/src"
WORKDIR ${SOURCE_DIR}

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "gl_image"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
