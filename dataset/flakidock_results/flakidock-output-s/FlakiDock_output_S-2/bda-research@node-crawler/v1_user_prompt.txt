Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
# Use the official Docker images
# https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/node/

FROM node:9.3.0-stretch

RUN apt-get update

RUN apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

RUN pip3 install --upgrade cffi
RUN pip3 install httpbin gunicorn


RUN npm install crawler -g


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
