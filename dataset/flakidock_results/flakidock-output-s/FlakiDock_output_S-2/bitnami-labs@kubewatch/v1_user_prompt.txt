Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM golang AS builder
MAINTAINER "Cuong Manh Le <cuong.manhle.vn@gmail.com>"

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential && \
    apt-get clean && \
    mkdir -p "$GOPATH/src/github.com/bitnami-labs/kubewatch"

ADD . "$GOPATH/src/github.com/bitnami-labs/kubewatch"

RUN cd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/bitnami-labs/kubewatch" && \
    CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -a --installsuffix cgo --ldflags="-s" -o /kubewatch

FROM bitnami/minideb:stretch
RUN install_packages ca-certificates

COPY --from=builder /kubewatch /bin/kubewatch

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/kubewatch"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
