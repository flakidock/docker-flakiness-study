Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM clojure:openjdk-8-lein-2.8.3

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | bash -
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install --yes build-essential nodejs

COPY project.clj /usr/src/app
RUN lein deps

COPY . /usr/src/app
RUN make

CMD ["lein", "run"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
