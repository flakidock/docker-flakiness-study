Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:13.12

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -yq make

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .
COPY package-lock.json .

RUN npm ci

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

CMD ["bash", "-c", "make db-setup && npm start"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
