# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.5.0

EXPOSE 3000

ENV HOME=/covoiturage-libre \
    PATH=/covoiturage-libre/bin:$PATH \
    PORT=3000

RUN apt-get update -qq && \
    apt-get install -y \
      build-essential \
      libpq-dev \
      nodejs

WORKDIR /covoiturage-libre

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock /covoiturage-libre/

RUN bundle install

COPY . $WORKDIR

CMD ["/bin/bash", "rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "3000"]

Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
