Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7-slim-stretch AS base

ENV PYROOT /pyroot
ENV PYTHONUSERBASE $PYROOT


FROM base AS builder

RUN pip install pipenv==2020.8.13 && \
    apt-get update -y && \
    apt-get install -y git

COPY Pipfile* /home/src/

WORKDIR /home/src

RUN PIP_USER=1 PIP_IGNORE_INSTALLED=1 pipenv install --system --deploy --ignore-pipfile

FROM base

COPY --from=builder $PYROOT/lib/ $PYROOT/lib/
COPY run.py /bin

CMD ["run.py"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
