Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.11-alpine

# Prepare dependencies
RUN apk add -U git

ENV GO111MODULES=auto

# Include sources
COPY . /go/src/github.com/kocircuit/kocircuit/

# Build ko
RUN \
    go get github.com/golang/protobuf/proto && \
    go get github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go/descriptor && \
    go build -o /go/bin/ko github.com/kocircuit/kocircuit/lang/ko

# Package ko container
FROM alpine

ENV GOPATH=/ko
WORKDIR $GOPATH

# Copy binary
COPY --from=0 /go/bin/ko /usr/bin/

# Copy library sources
COPY ./lib/ /ko/src/github.com/kocircuit/kocircuit/lib/

ENTRYPOINT [ "/usr/bin/ko" ]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
