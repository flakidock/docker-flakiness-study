Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:14.2

RUN \
    apt-get update \
    && \
    apt-get install -y \
        libx11-xcb1 \
        libxtst6 \
        libnss3 \
        libxss1 \
        libasound2 \
        libatk-bridge2.0-0 \
        libgtk-3-0 \
        fonts-wqy-zenhei \
    && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN \
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y \
    && \
    /root/.cargo/bin/cargo install oxipng

WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "npm", "run", "installandstartdev" ]

HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
