Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.5.3

RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential libpq-dev nodejs libssl-dev

RUN mkdir /joatu
WORKDIR /joatu
COPY Gemfile /joatu/Gemfile
COPY Gemfile.lock /joatu/Gemfile.lock

RUN gem install bundler -v 2.0.2

COPY . /joatu

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
