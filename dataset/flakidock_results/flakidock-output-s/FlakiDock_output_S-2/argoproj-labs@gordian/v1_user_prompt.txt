Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7-stretch AS builder

USER root
RUN mkdir /rep
COPY . /rep
WORKDIR /rep
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python-pip build-essential python-setuptools
RUN pip3 wheel . --wheel-dir=/rep/wheels

FROM python:3.7-stretch
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 python-pip python-setuptools && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY --from=builder /rep /rep
COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh
WORKDIR /rep
RUN pip3 install --no-index --find-links=/rep/wheels .
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["gordian"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
