Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM debian:stretch-slim
ENV GCSFUSE_REPO gcsfuse-stretch

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install --yes --no-install-recommends \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
  && echo "deb http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $GCSFUSE_REPO main" \
    | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gcsfuse.list \
  && curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add - \
  && apt-get update \
  && apt-get install --yes gcsfuse \
  && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* 

CMD ["sleep", "3600"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
