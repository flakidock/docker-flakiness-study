Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.10-stretch as builder

RUN mkdir -p /build
COPY update.go /build/
WORKDIR /build
RUN go build update.go

FROM debian:stretch-slim
RUN apt update && apt install -y ca-certificates git
COPY --from=builder /build/update /root/
COPY auto.sh /root/
CMD ["/root/auto.sh"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
