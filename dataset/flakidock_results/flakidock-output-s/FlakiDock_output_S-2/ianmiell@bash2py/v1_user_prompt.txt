Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM debian
RUN apt-get -y update && \
    apt-get -y install zip build-essential autoconf bison python vim git && \
    apt-get clean
WORKDIR /opt
COPY bash2py-3.5.zip /opt
RUN unzip /opt/bash2py-3.5.zip 
WORKDIR /opt/bash2py-3.5
RUN mkdir /root/bin
RUN sh install
CMD /bin/bash


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
