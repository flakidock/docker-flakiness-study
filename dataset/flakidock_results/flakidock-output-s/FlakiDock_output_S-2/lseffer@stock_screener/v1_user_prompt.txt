Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7-slim

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash worker \
    && apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y git netcat
COPY requirements.txt /requirements.txt
RUN python3 -m pip install -U pip setuptools \
    && python3 -m pip install -U -r /requirements.txt

USER worker
WORKDIR /home/worker
ENV PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${HOME}"

EXPOSE 5000 5050


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
