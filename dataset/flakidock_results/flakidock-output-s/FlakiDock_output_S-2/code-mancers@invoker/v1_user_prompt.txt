Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.3

MAINTAINER hemant@codemancers.com

RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install dnsmasq socat

CMD cd /invoker && bundle install --path vendor/ && bundle exec rake spec


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
