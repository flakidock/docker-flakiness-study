Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
#FROM node:9.8
FROM registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/zuowenbo/nodejs
MAINTAINER bjfumac "macvsapple@gmail.com"
RUN npm install  protobufjs chalk minimist glob tmp semver uglify-js espree escodegen estraverse -g
VOLUME ["/proto/"]
WORKDIR /
ADD build.sh build.sh
ADD fix.js fix.js
ADD asconverter.js asconverter.js
RUN chmod 777 /build.sh


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
