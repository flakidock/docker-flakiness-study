Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM debian:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install subversion build-essential libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk git ccache gettext libssl-dev xsltproc wget unzip python time -y

ADD . /app

WORKDIR /app

ENTRYPOINT ["/app/cooker"]
CMD ["--help"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
