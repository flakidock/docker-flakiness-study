Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3

WORKDIR /app

RUN wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/master/src/searchengine/nova3/helpers.py && \
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/master/src/searchengine/nova3/nova2.py && \
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/master/src/searchengine/nova3/nova2dl.py && \

COPY . /app

RUN chmod -R 777 /app/tests


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
