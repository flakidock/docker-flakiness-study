Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM maven:3.5-jdk-8-slim

# install git
RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get -y install git
RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* /usr/share/man/?? /usr/share/man/??_*

WORKDIR /usr/src/mymaven/
ENTRYPOINT []

VOLUME /root/.m2




Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
