Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
ARG ES_VERSION=7.6.2

FROM debian:stretch-slim AS build
LABEL maintainer="Petar ObradoviÄ‡ <spideyfusion@gmail.com>"

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y zip unzip

COPY . context/

RUN cd context && \
    script/build.sh \
    mkdir .build/dist && \
    unzip -d .build/dist .build/release.zip

FROM docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:${ES_VERSION}

COPY --chown=elasticsearch:elasticsearch --from=build /context/.build/dist/ /usr/share/elasticsearch/config/hunspell/hr_HR/


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
