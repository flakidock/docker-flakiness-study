Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:11-slim

LABEL "com.github.actions.name"="Report to packtracker.io"
LABEL "com.github.actions.description"="Report your webpack build stats to the packtracker.io service."
LABEL "com.github.actions.icon"="box"
LABEL "com.github.actions.color"="gray-dark"

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install jq git -y && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY ./entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
COPY ./report.js /report.js
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
