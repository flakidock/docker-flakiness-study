Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM circleci/ruby:2.3.8
USER root
RUN apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y openalpr openalpr-daemon openalpr-utils libopenalpr-dev
RUN mkdir /alpr
RUN chown -R circleci:circleci /alpr
USER circleci
WORKDIR /alpr
COPY . /alpr
RUN bundle install
COPY . /alpr


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
