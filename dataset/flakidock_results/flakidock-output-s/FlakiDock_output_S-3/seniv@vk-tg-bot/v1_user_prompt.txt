Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:10-slim as base

RUN mkdir /bot

WORKDIR /bot

ADD package.json /bot/package.json
ADD package-lock.json /bot/package-lock.json
ADD config.json /bot/config.json

RUN apt-get update &&\
    apt-get install -y jq &&\
    npm install --production &&\
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

FROM base

ADD src /bot/src
ADD start.sh /bot/start.sh

CMD ["sh", "start.sh"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
