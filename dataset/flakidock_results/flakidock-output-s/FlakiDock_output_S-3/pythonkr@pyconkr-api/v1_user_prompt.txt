Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.6.8-stretch

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
WORKDIR /config
COPY . /web
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y cron
ADD requirements.txt /config/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

WORKDIR /web
ENTRYPOINT ["/web/docker-entrypoint.sh"]

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
