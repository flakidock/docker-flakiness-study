Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM funkyfuture/nest-of-serpents

ENTRYPOINT tox
WORKDIR /src

RUN pip3.7 install black flake8 pre-commit pytest tox PyYAML Sphinx \
 && mkdir /home/tox \
 && mv /root/.cache /home/tox/

RUN useradd -m tox \
 && chown -R tox.tox /home/tox/.cache

ADD . .
RUN mkdir .tox \
 && chown -R tox.tox .

USER tox


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
