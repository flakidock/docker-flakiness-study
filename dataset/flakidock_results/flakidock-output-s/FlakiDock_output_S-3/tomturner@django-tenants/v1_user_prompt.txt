Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
#ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
RUN mkdir /code
VOLUME /code
WORKDIR /code
COPY requirements.txt /code/
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install postgresql libpq-dev postgresql-client postgresql-client-common python3-pip git netcat
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . /code/

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
