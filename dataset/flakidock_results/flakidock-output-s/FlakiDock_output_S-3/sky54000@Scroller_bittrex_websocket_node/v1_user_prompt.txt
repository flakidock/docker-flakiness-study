Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:carbon

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY src/package*.json ./

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y mysql-client default-libmysqlclient-dev mysql-common


RUN npm install && npm install js-yaml
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm install --only=production

# Bundle app source
COPY src/ .
COPY config.yml .
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 3306
CMD [ "node", "bittrex_listener.js" ]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
