# Dockerfile
FROM bvlc/caffe:cpu
ADD ./app /code
WORKDIR /code
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
