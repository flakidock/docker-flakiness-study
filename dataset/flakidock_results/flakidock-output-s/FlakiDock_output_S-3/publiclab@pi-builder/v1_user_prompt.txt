Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM hypriot/image-builder:latest

RUN apt-get update && \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y \
    binfmt-support \
    qemu \
    qemu-user-static \
    --no-install-recommends && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY builder/ /builder/

# build sd card image
CMD /builder/build.sh

Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
