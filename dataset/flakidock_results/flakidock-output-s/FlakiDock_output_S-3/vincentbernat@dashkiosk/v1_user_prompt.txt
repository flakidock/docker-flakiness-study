Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:10-stretch AS builder

RUN npm install -g bower grunt-cli
RUN apt-get -qq update && apt-get install -qqy libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev

WORKDIR /dashkiosk
COPY package.json /dashkiosk/
ENV NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL warn
RUN npm install
COPY . /dashkiosk/
RUN grunt
RUN cd dist && \
    npm install --production

FROM node:10-stretch-slim

RUN apt-get -qq update && apt-get install -qqy libavahi-compat-libdnssd1

WORKDIR /dashkiosk
COPY --from=builder /dashkiosk/entrypoint.sh /dashkiosk/
COPY --from=builder /dashkiosk/dist/ /dashkiosk/dist/
RUN chmod +x /dashkiosk/entrypoint.sh

# We use SQLite by default. If you want to keep the database between
# runs, don't forget to provide a volume for /database.
VOLUME /database

ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV port 8080
ENV db__options__storage /database/dashkiosk.sqlite

ENTRYPOINT [ "/dashkiosk/entrypoint.sh" ]
EXPOSE 8080


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
