Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.4

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends librrd-dev net-tools \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
ADD . /usr/src/app

RUN python manage.py migrate

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir honcho
CMD ["honcho", "start"]



Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
