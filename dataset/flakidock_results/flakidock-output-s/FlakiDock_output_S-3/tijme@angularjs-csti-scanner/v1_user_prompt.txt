Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:stretch
LABEL maintainer="txt3rob@gmail.com"

# update
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install locales git wget nano -y

# Set default locale for the environment
RUN locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANGUAGE en_US:en

RUN pip install git+https://github.com/tijme/angularjs-csti-scanner.git



CMD ["/bin/bash"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
