Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:2.7

LABEL maintainer "lucas@spideroak-inc.com"

# Update pip
RUN pip install --upgrade \
    pip

# Download and install Semaphor
RUN wget https://spideroak.com/releases/semaphor/debian \
    && dpkg -i debian \
    && rm -rf debian

COPY . /flow-python
WORKDIR /flow-python

# Install flow-python
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt \
&& pip install .

# Execute python to start using flow-python
CMD python


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
