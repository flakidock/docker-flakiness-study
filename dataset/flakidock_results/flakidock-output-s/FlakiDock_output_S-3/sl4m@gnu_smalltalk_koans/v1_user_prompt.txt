# Dockerfile
FROM debian:stretch-slim
MAINTAINER skim <skimla@gmail.com>

ENV HOME /root

RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade
RUN apt-get install -y gnu-smalltalk

WORKDIR /koans

Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
