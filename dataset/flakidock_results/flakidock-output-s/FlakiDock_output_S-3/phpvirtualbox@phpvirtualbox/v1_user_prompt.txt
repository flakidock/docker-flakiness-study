Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM php:5.6-apache
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y \
        libxml2 \
        libxml2-dev && \
    docker-php-ext-install soap
COPY . /var/www/html

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
