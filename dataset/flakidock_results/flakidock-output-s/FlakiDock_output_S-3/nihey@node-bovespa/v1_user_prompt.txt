Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:10

RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install cron

WORKDIR /var/www/

COPY package-lock.json package-lock.json
COPY package.json package.json
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

RUN crontab ./crons/updater.cron

EXPOSE 7000

CMD cron && npm run serve-production

Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
