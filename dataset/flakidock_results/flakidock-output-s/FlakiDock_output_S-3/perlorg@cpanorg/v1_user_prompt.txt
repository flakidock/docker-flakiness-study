Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM harbor.ntppool.org/perlorg/base-os:3.14.1

ENV LAST_UPDATED 2021-08-30

ADD Makefile .

USER root
RUN apk add rsync
RUN make install \
  && cpanm File::Rsync File::Rsync::Mirror::Recent \
          XML::RSS Linux::Inotify2 \
  && rm -fr ~/.cpanm


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content
