Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM node:lts-alpine AS builder
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm audit && npm i && npm run build

FROM alpine:3
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /app/dist
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip py3-pyldap py3-pytoml \
    && pip3 install --break-system-packages python-dotenv Quart
COPY app.py settings.py /app/

WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["/usr/bin/hypercorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "--access-logfile", "-", "app:app"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
