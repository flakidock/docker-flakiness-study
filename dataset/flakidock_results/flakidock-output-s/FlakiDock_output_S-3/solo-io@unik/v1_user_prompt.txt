Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.11.1

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl make git jq

ENV GOROOT=/usr/local/go
ENV GOPATH=/go
ENV PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin

RUN go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...

RUN mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/solo-io/
WORKDIR $GOPATH/src/github.com/solo-io/unik

COPY ./ $GOPATH/src/github.com/solo-io/unik

CMD make -e TARGET_OS=${TARGET_OS} localbuild && mv ./unik /opt/build/unik


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
