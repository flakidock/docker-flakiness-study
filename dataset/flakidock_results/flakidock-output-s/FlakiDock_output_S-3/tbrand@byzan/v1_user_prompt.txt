Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM rust:stretch

WORKDIR /usr/local/byzan

COPY . .

ENV PATH $PATH:/usr/local/byzan/target/release

RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install cmake golang -y

RUN rustup default stable
RUN cargo install protobuf-codegen
RUN cargo install grpcio-compiler
RUN cargo build --release


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
