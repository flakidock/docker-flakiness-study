Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7.3
WORKDIR /usr/local/app
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y groff-base
ADD Pipfile /usr/local/app
RUN pip install pipenv==2018.11.26 && pipenv install --skip-lock -d
ENTRYPOINT ["pipenv", "run"]


Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on Dockerfile provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness. Anything that can cause a Dockerfile show flaky behaviour during build procedure should be considered. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>
