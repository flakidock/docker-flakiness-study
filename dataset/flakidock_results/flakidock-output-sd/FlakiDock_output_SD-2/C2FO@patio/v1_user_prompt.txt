Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:12

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install netcat, and mysql/postgres so we can create additional DBs
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -y install netcat build-essential postgresql mysql-server && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /patio
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install -g grunt-cli && \
    npm install
COPY . .

ENTRYPOINT ["./docker-entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["test"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
