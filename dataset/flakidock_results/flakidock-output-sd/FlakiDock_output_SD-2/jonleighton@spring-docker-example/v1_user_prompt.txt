Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.3
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y nodejs

# We need the spring socket file to be readable by the local user on the host,
# so we need to set up a user account with the same UID. Change this if your
# UID is not 1000. Obviously there are ways to make this more flexible (build
# args etc).
RUN useradd --create-home --user-group --uid 1000 app

RUN mkdir /app && chown -R app:app /app
WORKDIR /app
USER app

ADD Gemfile /app/Gemfile
ADD Gemfile.lock /app/Gemfile.lock
RUN bundle install

ADD . /app
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
