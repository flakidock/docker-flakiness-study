Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.5.3

RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential libpq-dev nodejs libssl-dev

RUN mkdir /joatu
WORKDIR /joatu
COPY Gemfile /joatu/Gemfile
COPY Gemfile.lock /joatu/Gemfile.lock

RUN gem install bundler -v 2.0.2

COPY . /joatu```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [2/8] RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential libpq-dev nodejs libssl-dev:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
