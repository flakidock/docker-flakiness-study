Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM maddinat0r/debian-samp

RUN apt update && apt install -y uuid-dev:i386 curl
RUN curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Southclaws/sampctl/master/install-bin.sh | sh && cp sampctl /usr/bin/sampctl
ADD . .
RUN mkdir build
ENTRYPOINT [ "make", "build-inside" ]```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [2/5] RUN apt update && apt install -y uuid-dev:i386 curl:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content
