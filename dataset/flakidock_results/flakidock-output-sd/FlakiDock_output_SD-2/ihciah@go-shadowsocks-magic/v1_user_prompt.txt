Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM golang:1.11.3-alpine3.8 AS builder

RUN apk upgrade \
    && apk add git \
    && go get -ldflags '-w -s' \
        github.com/ihciah/go-shadowsocks-magic

FROM alpine:3.8

LABEL maintainer="ihciah <ihciah@gmail.com>"

RUN apk upgrade \
    && apk add bash tzdata \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

COPY --from=builder /go/bin/go-shadowsocks-magic /usr/bin/shadowsocks

ENTRYPOINT ["shadowsocks"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
