Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:3.10
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Allows docker to cache installed dependencies between builds
RUN pip install pipenv
RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Adds our application code to the image
COPY . /code
WORKDIR /code

RUN bash /code/setup_node_16.sh
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y dist-upgrade && apt-get -y install libmemcached-dev nodejs

# the version of node-sass that tailwind uses doesn't work with npm 5.x under node 10.x, which the debian docker image gives us
RUN npm install npm@latest -g

# even though this is where `which npm` points to, running `npm install` without the absolute path still runs npm 5.x,
# but using the absolute path gives us npm 6.x (current latest as of November 2020)
ENV NPM_BIN_PATH /usr/local/bin/npm

# install deps from Pipfile.lock
RUN pipenv install

EXPOSE 8000

# Migrates the database, builds CSS, uploads staticfiles, and runs the production server
CMD bash bin/entry-point.sh
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [8/9] RUN npm install npm@latest -g:
Get:2 http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates InRelease [kB]
/bin/sh: 1: npm: not found
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c npm install npm@latest -g" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
