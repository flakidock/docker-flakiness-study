Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# Minecraft 1.11 Dockerfile - Example with notes

# Use the offical Debian Docker image with a specified version tag, Stretch, so not all
# versions of Debian images are downloaded.
FROM debian:stretch

MAINTAINER Michael Chiang <mchiang@docker.com>

# Simple utility for download a specific version of the minecraft server.jar
ENV MINECRAFT_UTILITY https://github.com/marblenix/minecraft_downloader/releases/download/latest/minecraft_downloader_linux
# Version of minecraft to download
ENV MINECRAFT_VERSION latest

# Use APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) built in the Linux distro to download Java, a dependency
# to run Minecraft.
# First, we need to ensure the right repo is available for JRE 8
# Then we update apt
# Then we pull in all of our dependencies, 
# Finally, we download the correct .jar file using wget
# .jar file fetched from the official page https://minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/
RUN apt update; \
    apt install -y default-jre ca-certificates-java curl; \
    curl -sL "${MINECRAFT_UTILITY}" -o minecraft_downloader; \
    chmod +x ./minecraft_downloader; \
    ./minecraft_downloader -o minecraft_server_${MINECRAFT_VERSION}.jar;
# We do the above in a single line to reduce the number of layers in our container

# Sets working directory for the CMD instruction (also works for RUN, ENTRYPOINT commands)
# Create mount point, and mark it as holding externally mounted volume
WORKDIR /data
VOLUME /data

# Expose the container's network port: 25565 during runtime.
EXPOSE 25565

#Automatically accept Minecraft EULA, and start Minecraft server
CMD echo eula=true > /data/eula.txt && java -jar /minecraft_server_${MINECRAFT_VERSION}.jar
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
