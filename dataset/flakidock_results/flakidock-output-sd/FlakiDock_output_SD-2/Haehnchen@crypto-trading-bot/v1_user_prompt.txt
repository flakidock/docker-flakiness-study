Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:10

MAINTAINER Daniel Espendiller <daniel@espendiller.net>

# Install build-essential, sqlite in order
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    sqlite \
&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
COPY package.json /usr/src/app/
RUN npm install --production && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Bundle app source
COPY . /usr/src/app

# Apply all patches in app
RUN npm run postinstall

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
