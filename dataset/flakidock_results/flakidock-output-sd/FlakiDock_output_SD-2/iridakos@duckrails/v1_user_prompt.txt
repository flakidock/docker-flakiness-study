Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.4-stretch
LABEL maintainer="Lazarus Lazaridis http://iridakos.com"

# Change to repo directory
WORKDIR /opt/duckrails

# From now on execute rails stuff in production mode
ENV RAILS_ENV production
ENV RACK_ENV production

# Expose container port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Add Required Packages
RUN apt-get update \
	  && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends nodejs libpq-dev libxml2-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev libsqlite3-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Add docker entrypoint.sh
COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /

# Copy in Gemfile
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./

# Install Gems
RUN bundle install --deployment --without development test --binstubs --jobs=2 --retry=4

# Copy in the rest of the app
COPY . .

# Configure database & install gems
COPY config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml

# Compile the assets
RUN bundle exec rake assets:precompile

# Add entrypoint for running db:migrations on upgrades
# and setting a unique SECRET_KEY_BASE value if not already set
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]

# Start the server
CMD ["puma"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
