Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# Run 'docker build --target rockerh3 -t crazycapivara/rocker-h3-only:latest .',
# if you want to build the image without 'sf'

FROM rocker/tidyverse:3.5.3 AS rockerh3

LABEL maintainer="Stefan Kuethe <crazycapivara@gmail.com>"

ENV BRANCH master

RUN apt-get update \
  && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends cmake

# RUN git clone --single-branch -b $BRANCH https://github.com/crazycapivara/h3-r.git
COPY . /h3-r

RUN cd h3-r \
  && chmod +x install-h3c.sh \
  && bash ./install-h3c.sh \
  && R -q -e 'devtools::install()' \
  && cd .. \
  && rm -rf h3-r

FROM rockerh3 AS rockerh3sf

RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  libudunits2-dev \
  libgdal-dev

RUN install2.r --error \
  sf \
  leaflet

```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content
