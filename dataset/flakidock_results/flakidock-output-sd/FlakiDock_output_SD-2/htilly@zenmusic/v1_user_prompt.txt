Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:17-alpine as intermediate
LABEL stage=intermediate

RUN apk update && \
    apk upgrade && \
    apk add git && \
    git clone https://github.com/htilly/zenmusic.git

FROM node:17-alpine
RUN mkdir app
COPY --from=intermediate /zenmusic/* /app/
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install

CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [stage-1 5/5] RUN npm install:
npm notice 
npm notice New major version of npm available! 8.-> 10.8.2
npm notice Changelog: <https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v10.8.2>

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
