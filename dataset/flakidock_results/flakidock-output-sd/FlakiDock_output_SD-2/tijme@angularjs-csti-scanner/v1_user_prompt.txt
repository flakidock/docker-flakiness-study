Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:stretch
LABEL maintainer="txt3rob@gmail.com"

# update
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install locales git wget nano -y

# Set default locale for the environment
RUN locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANGUAGE en_US:en

RUN pip install git+https://github.com/tijme/angularjs-csti-scanner.git



CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
