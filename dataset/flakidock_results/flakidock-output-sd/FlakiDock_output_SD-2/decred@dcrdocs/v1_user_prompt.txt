Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# Build image
FROM python:3.9

LABEL description="dcrdocs build"
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL maintainer "jholdstock@decred.org"

USER root
WORKDIR /root

RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip

COPY ./ /root/

RUN pip install mkdocs && \
	pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# Install dependencies for generating social cards.
# https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards
RUN apt update && \
    apt install libcairo2-dev libfreetype6-dev libffi-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libz-dev && \
	pip install pillow cairosvg

ENV DCRDOCS_CARDS true

RUN ./bin/build_docs.sh

# Serve image (stable nginx version)
FROM nginx:1.20

LABEL description="dcrdocs serve"
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL maintainer "jholdstock@decred.org"

COPY conf/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

COPY --from=0 ./root/site/ /usr/share/nginx/html
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [stage-0 7/7] RUN ./bin/build_docs.sh:
    self.font = self._load_font(config)
  File "/root/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/material/plugins/social/plugin.py", line 355, in _load_font
    self._load_font_from_google(name)
  File "/root/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/material/plugins/social/plugin.py", line 379, in _load_font_from_google
    zip = ZipFile(tmp)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/zipfile.py", line 1268, in __init__
    self._RealGetContents()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/zipfile.py", line 1335, in _RealGetContents
    raise BadZipFile("File is not a zip file")
zipfile.BadZipFile: File is not a zip file
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c ./bin/build_docs.sh" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
