Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:10-alpine
LABEL Description="This image is used to start the hc-api-feathers" Vendor="Human-Connection gGmbH" Version="1.0" Maintainer="Human-Connection gGmbH (developer@human-connection.org)"

# expose the app port
EXPOSE 3030

# override configuration by instance name in docker container
ENV NODE_APP_INSTANCE=docker
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# create working directory
RUN mkdir -p /API
WORKDIR /API

# --no-cache: download package index on-the-fly, no need to cleanup afterwards
# --virtual: bundle packages, remove whole bundle at once, when done
RUN apk --no-cache --virtual build-dependencies add python make g++

RUN yarn global add pm2

# install app dependencies
COPY package.json /API
COPY yarn.lock /API
RUN yarn install --production=false --frozen-lockfile --non-interactive

RUN apk del build-dependencies


# copy the code to the docker image
COPY . /API

# start the application in a autohealing cluster
# NOTE: quick fix for server issues, restart api when reaching max of 300 MB Memory Usage (happens in conjunction with 100% CPU Usage)
# TODO: find better way of dealing with that issue
CMD ["pm2", "start", "server/index.js", "-n", "api", "--attach", "--max-memory-restart", "1024M"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content
