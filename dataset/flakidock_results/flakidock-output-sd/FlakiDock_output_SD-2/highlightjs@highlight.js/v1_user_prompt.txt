Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# Dockerfile for highlight.js
#
# Build image:
#   docker build -t highlight-js .
#
# Run container:
#   docker run --rm -it --publish 8080:80 highlight-js
#
#   And open a browser to http://localhost:8080

FROM node:12-slim
RUN apt-get update -qq \
    && apt-get install --yes --no-install-recommends \
        nginx git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
WORKDIR /var/www/html
COPY package*.json /var/www/html/
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN node tools/build.js :common
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
