Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM daocloud.io/python:3-onbuild

MAINTAINER Robin<robin.chen@b-uxin.com>

ENV LANG C.UTF-8

RUN  mkdir -p /app

WORKDIR /app

COPY /app /app
COPY base.txt /app
COPY requirements.txt /app

#安装Python程序运行的依赖库
RUN cd /app && pip install -r base.txt
RUN cd /app && pip install -r requirements.txt


EXPOSE 80


ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/app/ok_trade.py"]```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [10/8] RUN cd /app && pip install -r base.txt:
Collecting requests==2.(from -r base.txt (line 1))
  Could not fetch URL https://pypi.python.org/simple/requests/: There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:748) - skipping
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement requests==2.(from -r base.txt (line 1)) (from versions: )

ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c cd /app && pip install -r base.txt" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
