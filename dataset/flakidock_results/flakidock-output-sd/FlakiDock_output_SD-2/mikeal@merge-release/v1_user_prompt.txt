Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:12-slim

LABEL version="1.0.0"
LABEL repository="http://github.com/mikeal/merge-release"
LABEL homepage="http://github.com/merge-release"
LABEL maintainer="Mikeal Rogers <mikeal.rogers@gmail.com>"

LABEL com.github.actions.name="Automated releases for npm packages."
LABEL com.github.actions.description="Release npm package based on commit metadata."
LABEL com.github.actions.icon="package"
LABEL com.github.actions.color="red"

RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y --no-install-recommends install git jq findutils curl ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY . .

# Install dependencies here
RUN cd src && npm i

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["help"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
