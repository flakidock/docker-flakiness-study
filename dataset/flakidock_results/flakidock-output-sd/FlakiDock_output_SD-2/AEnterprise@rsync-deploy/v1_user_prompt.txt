Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM debian:9.5-slim

RUN apt update
RUN apt -yq install rsync openssh-client


# Label
LABEL "com.github.actions.name"="Deploy with rsync"
LABEL "com.github.actions.description"="Deploy to a remote server using rsync over ssh"
LABEL "com.github.actions.color"="green"
LABEL "com.github.actions.icon"="truck"

LABEL "repository"="http://github.com/AEnterprise/rsync-deploy"
LABEL "homepage"="https://github.com/AEnterprise/rsync-deploy"
LABEL "maintainer"="AEnterprise <aenterprise@aenterprise.info>"


ADD entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content
