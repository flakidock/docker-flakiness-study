Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:3.6.8-stretch

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
WORKDIR /config
COPY . /web
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y cron
ADD requirements.txt /config/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

WORKDIR /web
ENTRYPOINT ["/web/docker-entrypoint.sh"]```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
