Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM golang:1.20.1-buster

# hadolint ignore=DL3027
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt install apt-transport-https build-essential curl gnupg2 jq lintian rsync rubygems-integration ruby-dev ruby software-properties-common sudo -qy \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# hadolint ignore=DL3028
RUN gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc --quiet rake fpm package_cloud
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
