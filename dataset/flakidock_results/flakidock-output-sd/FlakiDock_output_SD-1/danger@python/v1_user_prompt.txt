Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:3.7

LABEL maintainer="Jakub Turek <jkbturek@gmail.com>"
LABEL "com.github.actions.name"="danger-python"
LABEL "com.github.actions.description"="Runs Python Dangerfiles"
LABEL "com.github.actions.icon"="zap"
LABEL "com.github.actions.color"="blue"

# Install dependencies
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash -
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs

RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install poetry

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/danger-python
COPY . /usr/src/danger-python
RUN cd /usr/src/danger-python && \
    poetry config virtualenvs.create false && \
    poetry install --no-dev

ENTRYPOINT ["npx", "--package", "danger", "danger-python", "ci"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [2/8] RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash -:

+ apt-get install -y lsb-release > /dev/null 2>&1
## Confirming "bookworm" is supported...
+ curl -sLf -o /dev/null 'https://deb.nodesource.com/node_10.x/dists/bookworm/Release'
## Your distribution, identified as "bookworm", is not currently supported, please contact NodeSource at https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/issues if you think this is incorrect or would like your distribution to be considered for support
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash -" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
