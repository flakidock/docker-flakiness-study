Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.5.0

LABEL maintainer="https://github.com/covoiturage-libre/covoiturage-libre" \
      description="Carpooling Open Source platform"

EXPOSE 3000

ENV HOME=/covoiturage-libre \
    PATH=/covoiturage-libre/bin:$PATH \
    PORT=3000

RUN apt-get update -qq && \
    apt-get install -y \
      build-essential \
      libpq-dev \
      nodejs

WORKDIR /covoiturage-libre

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock /covoiturage-libre/

RUN bundle install

COPY . $WORKDIR

CMD ["/bin/bash", "rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "3000"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
