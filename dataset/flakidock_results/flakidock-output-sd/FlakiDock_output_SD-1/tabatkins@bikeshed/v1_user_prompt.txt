Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:3.9-bullseye as base

# Get the latest spec-data, then cache it so we don't have to redo this on every rebuild
from base as specdata
RUN mkdir /bikeshed-master
WORKDIR /bikeshed-master
RUN git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git /bikeshed-master
RUN pip install --editable /bikeshed-master
RUN bikeshed update

FROM base as builder
RUN mkdir /install
WORKDIR /install

COPY requirements.txt /requirements.txt
RUN pip install --prefix=/install -r /requirements.txt

FROM base
RUN mkdir -p /app/bikeshed
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /install /usr/local
COPY --from=specdata /bikeshed-master/bikeshed/spec-data /app/bikeshed/spec-data

# setup.py opens README.md, semver.txt and requirements.txt so they must be copied.
COPY setup.py README.md semver.txt requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install --editable .

COPY .git /app/.git
COPY bikeshed.py /app/
COPY bikeshed /app/bikeshed
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [specdata 3/5] RUN git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git /bikeshed-master:
Cloning into '/bikeshed-master'...
warning: Could not find remote branch master to clone.
fatal: Remote branch master not found in upstream origin
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git /bikeshed-master" did not complete successfully: exit code: 128```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
