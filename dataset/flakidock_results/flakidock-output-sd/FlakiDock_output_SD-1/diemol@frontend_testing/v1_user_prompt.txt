Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# Build
#  docker build -t fe .
# Use
#  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosel/t/i/p | bash -s start
#  docker run --rm -ti --net container:zalenium fe
#  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosel/t/i/p | bash -s stop
FROM node:7

RUN apt-get -qqy update \
  && apt-get -qqy install \
    git-core \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN git clone https://github.com/diemol/frontend_testing.git

RUN ln -sf /frontend_testing/page-objects/js-webdriverio/complete /js-webdriverio

WORKDIR /js-webdriverio
RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "test"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
