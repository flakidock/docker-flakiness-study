Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```#Use ruby-2.1.5 official image
FROM ruby:2.1.5

MAINTAINER Tushar Dwivedi  <tushar@octo.ai>

#Install dependencies:
RUN apt-get update

#Set ENV variable to store app inside the image
ENV INSTALL_PATH  /apps
RUN mkdir -p $INSTALL_PATH

#Ensure gems are cached and only get updated when they change.
WORKDIR /tmp
COPY  Gemfile /tmp/Gemfile
COPY Gemfile.lock /tmp/Gemfile.lock
RUN bundle install

#Copy application code from workstation to the working directory
COPY  . $INSTALL_PATH

#Entry Point
WORKDIR $INSTALL_PATH
CMD bundle exec unicorn -o 0.0.0.0 -p 9002
EXPOSE 9002```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
