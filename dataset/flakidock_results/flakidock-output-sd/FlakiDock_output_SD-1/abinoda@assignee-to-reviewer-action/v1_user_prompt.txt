Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM debian:9.6-slim

LABEL "com.github.actions.name"="Assignee to reviewer"
LABEL "com.github.actions.description"="Automatically create review requests based on assignees"
LABEL "com.github.actions.icon"="arrow-up-right"
LABEL "com.github.actions.color"="gray-dark"

LABEL version="1.0.4"
LABEL repository="http://github.com/pullreminders/assignee-to-reviewer-action"
LABEL homepage="http://github.com/pullreminders/assignee-to-reviewer-action"
LABEL maintainer="Abi Noda <abi@pullreminders.com>"

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    jq

ADD entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
