Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:3.7

RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | bash -

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y\
  build-essential libpq-dev nodejs nginx-extras

ENV NODE_PATH /usr/lib/node_modules

RUN pip install uwsgi

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY ui/package.json ./ui/

WORKDIR /usr/src/app/ui
RUN npm install


COPY . /usr/src/app

ENV NODE_ENV production
RUN npm run build
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/
COPY nginx-server.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
EXPOSE 80
CMD './start.sh'
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [10/15] RUN npm install:
/bin/sh: 1: npm: not found
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c npm install" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
