Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM debian:stable-slim

ADD . /code
WORKDIR /code
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive

# try to provide binary packages for requirements.txt, amend this list if necessary
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    python3-setuptools \
    python3-wheel \
    python3-pip \
    python3-numpy \
    python3-nibabel \
    python3-matplotlib \
    python3-imageio \
    python3-skimage

# should not build things from source, can be forced with '--only-binary all'
RUN pip3 install --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed .

# minor cleanup
RUN apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt && \
    rm -rf /code/gifs

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/gif_your_nifti"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [5/6] RUN pip3 install --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed .:
error: externally-managed-environment
× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.
    
    See /usr/share/doc/python3.11/README.venv for more information.
note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c pip3 install --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed ." did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
