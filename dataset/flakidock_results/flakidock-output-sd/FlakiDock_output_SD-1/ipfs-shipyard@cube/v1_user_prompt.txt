Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM clojure:openjdk-8-lein-2.8.3

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | bash -
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install --yes build-essential nodejs

COPY project.clj /usr/src/app
RUN lein deps

COPY . /usr/src/app
RUN make

CMD ["lein", "run"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
