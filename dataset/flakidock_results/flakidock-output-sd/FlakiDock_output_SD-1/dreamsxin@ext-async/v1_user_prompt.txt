Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM php:7.3.4-zts

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev libxml2-dev autoconf bison bash automake libtool

COPY . /usr/local/ext-async
WORKDIR /usr/local/ext-async

RUN phpize --clean
RUN phpize
RUN ./configure
RUN make install -B

RUN cat ./defaults.ini >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/async.ini

RUN php -v
RUN php -m

CMD ["/bin/sh"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
