Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# Heroku-16 is based on Ubuntu 16.4
# Debian Stretch is the upstream of Ubuntu 16.4
FROM ruby:2.6.4-stretch
MAINTAINER Darin London <darin.london@duke.edu>

# NodeJS and npm
## Heroku-16 uses node 10.14. This installs node 10.15
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs

#Postgresql client
RUN /usr/bin/apt-get update && /usr/bin/apt-get install -y postgresql libpq-dev

#GraphViz for Rails ERD

RUN ["bundle", "config", "build.nokogiri", "--use-system-libraries"]
RUN ["bundle", "install", "--jobs=4"]

# run the app by defualt
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["puma"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
