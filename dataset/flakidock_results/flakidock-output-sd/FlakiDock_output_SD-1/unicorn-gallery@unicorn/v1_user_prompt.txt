Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM php:5.6-fpm

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y git \
    zip \
    libpng-dev \
    libjpeg62-turbo-dev \
    libfreetype6-dev

RUN docker-php-ext-configure gd --with-freetype-dir=/usr/include/ --with-jpeg-dir=/usr/include/
RUN docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) gd
RUN echo "date.timezone = UTC" > /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/date.timezone.ini

RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php \
    && mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/ \
    && ln -s /usr/local/bin/composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

COPY composer.json composer.lock /app/
WORKDIR /app
RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /app

ENV COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER 1
CMD bash -c "composer install && php-fpm"\
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
