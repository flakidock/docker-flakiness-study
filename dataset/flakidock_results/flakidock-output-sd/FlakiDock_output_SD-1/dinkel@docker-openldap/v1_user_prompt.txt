Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM debian:stretch

MAINTAINER Christian Luginb√ºhl <dinkel@pimprecords.com>

ENV OPENLDAP_VERSION 2.4.44

RUN apt-get update && \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
        slapd=${OPENLDAP_VERSION}* && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN mv /etc/ldap /etc/ldap.dist

COPY modules/ /etc/ldap.dist/modules

COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

EXPOSE 389

VOLUME ["/etc/ldap", "/var/lib/ldap"]

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

CMD ["slapd", "-d", "32768", "-u", "openldap", "-g", "openldap"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
