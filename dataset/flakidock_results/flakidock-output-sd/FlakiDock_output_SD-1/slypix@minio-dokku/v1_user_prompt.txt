Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM minio/minio:latest

# Add user dokku with an individual UID
RUN adduser -u 32769 -m -U dokku
USER dokku

# Create data directory for the user, where we will keep the data
RUN mkdir -p /home/dokku/data

# Add custom nginx.conf template for Dokku to use
WORKDIR /app
ADD nginx.conf.sigil .

CMD ["minio", "server", "/home/dokku/data", "--console-address", ":9001"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [2/5] RUN adduser -u 32769 -m -U dokku:
/bin/sh: line 1: adduser: command not found
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c adduser -u 32769 -m -U dokku" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
