Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM damianh/dotnet-core-lts-sdks:2

WORKDIR /repo

# https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/15858
# Docker will flatten out the file structure on COPY
# We don't want to specify each csproj either - it creates pointless layers and it looks ugly
# https://code-maze.com/aspnetcore-app-dockerfiles/
COPY ./*.sln ./

COPY ./build/ ./build/

COPY ./src/*/*.csproj ./src/
RUN for file in $(ls src/*.csproj); do mkdir -p ./${file%.*}/ && mv $file ./${file%.*}/; done

COPY ./tests/*/*.csproj ./tests/
RUN for file in $(ls tests/*.csproj); do mkdir -p ./${file%.*}/ && mv $file ./${file%.*}/; done

RUN dotnet restore

COPY ./assets ./assets/

COPY ./src ./src/

COPY ./tests ./tests/

WORKDIR /repo/build

COPY ./build/build.csproj .

RUN dotnet restore

COPY ./build .

WORKDIR /repo
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [internal] load metadata for docker.io/damianh/dotnet-core-lts-sdks:2:
ERROR: pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: server message: insufficient_scope: authorization failed```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
