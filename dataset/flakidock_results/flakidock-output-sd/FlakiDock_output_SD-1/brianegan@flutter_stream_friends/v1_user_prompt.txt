Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM johnpryan/dart-content-shell-docker

MAINTAINER brian@brianegan.com

RUN apt-get update

WORKDIR /
RUN git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
RUN /flutter/bin/flutter

ENV PATH $PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin:/flutter/bin
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
