Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:12.13.0-stretch

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
# python dependencies for balrog submitter
RUN apt-get update --no-install-recommends \
  && apt-get install -y \
  python python-pip
RUN pip install \
  awscli==1.15.32 \
  pycrypto==2.6.1 \
  requests==2.18.4

# update npm and prepare dependencies
RUN mkdir /app
RUN chown node:node -R /app
USER node
COPY package.json /app/
COPY package-lock.json /app/
COPY postinstall.sh /app/

# get balrog submitter script
RUN wget -O /app/submitter.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cliqz-oss/browser-core/master/fern/submitter.py

WORKDIR /app/
RUN npm ci
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
