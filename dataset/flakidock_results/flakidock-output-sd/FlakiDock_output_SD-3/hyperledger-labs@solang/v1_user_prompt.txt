Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ghcr.io/hyperledger/solang-llvm:ci as builder

COPY . src
WORKDIR /src/stdlib/
RUN make

RUN rustup default 1.64.0

WORKDIR /src
RUN cargo build --release

FROM ubuntu:20.04
COPY --from=builder /src/target/release/solang /usr/bin/solang

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="Solang Solidity Compiler" \
	org.opencontainers.image.licenses="Apache-2.0"

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/solang"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [builder 7/7] RUN cargo build --release:
  Downloaded regex-syntax v0.8.4

  Downloaded tokio v1.39.2

error: package `regex v1.10.5` cannot be built because it requires rustc or newer, while the currently active rustc version is 1.64.0
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c cargo build --release" did not complete successfully: exit code: 101```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
