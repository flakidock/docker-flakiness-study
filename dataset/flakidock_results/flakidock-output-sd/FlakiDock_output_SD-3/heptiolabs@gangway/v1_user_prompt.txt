Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM golang:1.14.2-stretch
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/heptiolabs/gangway

RUN go get -u github.com/mjibson/esc/...
COPY . .
RUN esc -o cmd/gangway/bindata.go templates/

ENV GO111MODULE on
RUN go mod verify
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go install -ldflags="-w -s" -v github.com/heptiolabs/gangway/...

FROM debian:9.12-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates
USER 1001:1001
COPY --from=0 /go/bin/gangway /bin/gangway
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content
