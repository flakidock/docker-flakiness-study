Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.3.8

RUN apt-get update && \
  apt-get install -y qt5-default libqt5webkit5-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
                     gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-x

ENV app /usr/src/app

# Create app directory
RUN mkdir -p $app
WORKDIR $app

# Bundle app source
COPY . $app

# Install app dependencies
RUN bundle install

# dumb-init
ADD dumb-init_1.2.0 /usr/bin/dumb-init
RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/dumb-init

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/dumb-init", "--"]
CMD [ "bundle", "exec", "rails", "server" ]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
