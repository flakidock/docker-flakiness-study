Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM golang:1.13-stretch as builder

RUN export GO111MODULE=on \
    && export GOPROXY=https://goproxy.io \
    && mkdir -p /go/src/github.com/Kucoin/kumex-level3-sdk

COPY . /go/src/github.com/Kucoin/kumex-level3-sdk

RUN cd /go/src/github.com/Kucoin/kumex-level3-sdk \
    && CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags '-s -w' -o /go/bin/kumex_market kumex_market.go

FROM debian:stretch

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install ca-certificates -y

COPY --from=builder /go/bin/kumex_market /usr/local/bin/

# .env => /app/.env
WORKDIR /app
VOLUME /app

EXPOSE 9090

COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/
ENTRYPOINT ["docker-entrypoint.sh"]

CMD ["kumex_market", "-c", "/app/.env", "-symbol", "XBTUSDM", "-p", "9090", "-rpckey", "XBTUSDM"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
