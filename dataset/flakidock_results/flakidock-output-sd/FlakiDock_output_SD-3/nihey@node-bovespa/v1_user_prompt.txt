Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:10

RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install cron

WORKDIR /var/www/

COPY package-lock.json package-lock.json
COPY package.json package.json
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

RUN crontab ./crons/updater.cron

EXPOSE 7000

CMD cron && npm run serve-production
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
