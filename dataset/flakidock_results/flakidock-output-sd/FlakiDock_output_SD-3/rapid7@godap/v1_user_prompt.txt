Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM golang:1.12.3-stretch

RUN apt-get update
# install bats
RUN git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/bats.git && cd bats && ./install.sh /usr

# install godap requirements
RUN apt-get install -y libpcap0.8-dev libgeoip-dev jq

# build and install godap, but call it *dap* for sake of simplifying testing between dap and godap
WORKDIR /opt/godap
COPY . .
RUN go install -v -tags="libpcap libgeoip"
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
