Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# Create an up to date minimal Debian Jessi build

# Pull base image
FROM debian:jessie

# Update packages
RUN apt-get update && \
  apt-get upgrade -y && \
  apt-get clean -y && \
  apt-get autoclean -y && \
  apt-get autoremove -y && \
  rm -rf /usr/share/locale/* && \
  rm -rf /var/cache/debconf/*-old && \
  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && \
  rm -rf /usr/share/doc/*
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
