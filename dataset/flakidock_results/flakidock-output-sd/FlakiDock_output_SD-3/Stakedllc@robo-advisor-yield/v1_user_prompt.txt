Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# Start with node 10.15.0
FROM node:lts-stretch-slim
RUN apt update && apt install --assume-yes git python curl dnsutils build-essential

ARG buildtime_settings=local_docker
ENV SETTINGS_ENV=$buildtime_settings

RUN mkdir /source

WORKDIR /source

COPY package.json /source/
COPY yarn.lock /source/

RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-optional --non-interactive
RUN yarn global add truffle@5.0.2

COPY . /source/

ENTRYPOINT ["/source/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["none"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
