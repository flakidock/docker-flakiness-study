Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:lts-alpine AS builder
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm audit && npm i && npm run build

FROM alpine:3
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /app/dist
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip py3-pyldap py3-pytoml \
    && pip3 install 'python-dotenv==0.19.*' \
        'Hypercorn==0.13.*' 'Jinja2<3.1.0' 'Quart==0.16.*'
COPY app.py settings.py /app

WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["/usr/bin/hypercorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "--access-logfile", "-", "app:app"]
```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content
