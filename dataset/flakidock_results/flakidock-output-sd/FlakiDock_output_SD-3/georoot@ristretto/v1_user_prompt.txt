Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:boron
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json /usr/src/app/
RUN npm install
COPY . /usr/src/app

RUN apt-get update

RUN apt-get -y install openssh-client
RUN ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -N '' -f /id_rsa

RUN apt-get -y install nginx
RUN rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
COPY config/nginx/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
RUN service nginx start

EXPOSE 8090
EXPOSE 80
CMD [ "node","bin/ristretto.js"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
