Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM harbor.ntppool.org/perlorg/base-os:3.14.1

ENV LAST_UPDATED 2021-08-30

ADD Makefile .

USER root
RUN apk add rsync
RUN make install \
  && cpanm File::Rsync File::Rsync::Mirror::Recent \
          XML::RSS Linux::Inotify2 \
  && rm -fr ~/.cpanm
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [internal] load metadata for harbor.ntppool.org/perlorg/base-os:3.14.1:
ERROR: harbor.ntppool.org/perlorg/base-os:3.14.1: not found```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
