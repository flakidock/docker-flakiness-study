Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.7.2
LABEL maintainer="xatier <xatierlike@gmail.com>"

# prepare WORKDIR for our project
ARG dir=/srv/www/archlinux.tw
RUN mkdir -p $dir
WORKDIR $dir
COPY . $dir

# build project
RUN gem install bundler && bundle install

CMD ["/usr/local/bundle/bin/jekyll", "server", "-H", "0.0.0.0"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [5/5] RUN gem install bundler && bundle install:
ERROR:  Error installing bundler:
	The last version of bundler (>= 0) to support your Ruby & RubyGems was 2.4.22. Try installing it with `gem install bundler -v 2.4.22`
	bundler requires Ruby version >= 3.0.0. The current ruby version is 2.7.2.137.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c gem install bundler && bundle install" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
