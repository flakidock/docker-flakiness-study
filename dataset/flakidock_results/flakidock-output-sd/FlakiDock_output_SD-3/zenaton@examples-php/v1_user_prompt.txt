Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM composer

FROM php:7.2-cli-stretch

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install git unzip -y

WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 4001

COPY --from=composer /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer

COPY ./bin /app/bin
COPY ./src /app/src
COPY ./start_zenaton /app/start_zenaton
COPY composer.json composer.lock ./

RUN composer install

# Install Zenaton
RUN curl https://install.zenaton.com | sh

ENTRYPOINT ["./start_zenaton"]```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
