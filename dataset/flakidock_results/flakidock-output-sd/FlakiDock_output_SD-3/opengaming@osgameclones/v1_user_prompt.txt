Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM alpine AS builder

RUN mkdir /src /app
WORKDIR /src
COPY . /src/
COPY CHECKS /app/CHECKS

RUN apk add --no-cache curl make gcc musl-dev libffi-dev python3 python3-dev
RUN env
RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_HOME=/etc/poetry python3 -

ENV PATH /etc/poetry/bin/:$PATH

RUN poetry install
RUN make run 

FROM nginx:1.17-alpine

COPY --from=builder /src/_build /www
COPY vhost.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
COPY CHECKS /app/CHECKS
EXPOSE 80
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [builder  9/10] RUN poetry install:
Creating virtualenv osgameclones-VsnhxLU2-pyin /root/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs
Installing dependencies from lock file
pyproject.toml changed significantly since poetry.lock was last generated. Run `poetry lock [--no-update]` to fix the lock file.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c poetry install" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
