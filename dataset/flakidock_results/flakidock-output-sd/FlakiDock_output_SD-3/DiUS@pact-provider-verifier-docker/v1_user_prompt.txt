Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2-alpine

COPY Gemfile /app/
COPY Gemfile.lock /app/
RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual build-dependencies build-base && \
    gem install bundler && \
    cd /app; bundle install && \
    apk del build-dependencies build-base && \
    rm -r ~/.bundle/ /usr/local/bundle/cache
COPY src/ /app/

WORKDIR /app

CMD bundle exec rake verify_pacts
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
