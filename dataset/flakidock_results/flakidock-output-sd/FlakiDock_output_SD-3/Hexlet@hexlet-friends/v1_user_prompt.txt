Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:3.11-alpine as builder

ENV PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1 \
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=on \
    POETRY_VERSION=1.2.2 \
    POETRY_NO_INTERACTION=1 \
    POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE=false \
    POETRY_CACHE_DIR='/var/cache/pypoetry' \
    PATH="$PATH:/root/.local/bin"

RUN apk add --no-cache \
    gcc \
    musl-dev \
    postgresql-dev \
    libffi-dev \
    openssl-dev \
    cargo \
    curl \
    gettext \
    git \
    make 

RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - \
    && poetry --version

WORKDIR /project/

COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./

RUN poetry install --extras psycopg2-binary

WORKDIR /usr/local/src/hexlet-friends

CMD ["make", "start"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
