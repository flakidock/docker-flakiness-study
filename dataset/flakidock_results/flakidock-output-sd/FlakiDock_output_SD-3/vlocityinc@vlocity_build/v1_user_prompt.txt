Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:10
RUN dpkg --add-architecture i386

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y jq
RUN apt-get install -y libc6:i386 libstdc++6:i386

RUN npm install --global sfdx-cli@7.45.1
RUN npm install --global publish-release 

RUN npm install --global pkg-fetch
#RUN pkg-fetch -n node10 -p win -a x64
RUN pkg-fetch -n node10 -p linux -a x64
RUN pkg-fetch -n node10 -p macos -a x64

RUN npm install --global pkg@4.3.8

# declare /vlocity_build as working directory of image
WORKDIR /vlocity_build

COPY ./package*.json /vlocity_build/

RUN npm install

# Important to do this final part last because of how docker builds image
# copy all remaining files/folders in project directory to the container
COPY . /vlocity_build```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
