Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM php:5.6-cli

WORKDIR /home/authy-php
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

RUN  apt-get update \
  && apt-get install -y wget \
  && apt-get install -y unzip \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Composer (See: https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md)
RUN wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/composer/getcomposer.org/1b137f8bf6db3e79a38a5bc45324414a6b1f9df2/web/installer -O - -q | php -- --install-dir=/bin --filename=composer

# PHPUnit
RUN wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-5.7.phar
RUN chmod +x phpunit-5.7.phar
RUN mv phpunit-5.7.phar /bin/phpunit
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
