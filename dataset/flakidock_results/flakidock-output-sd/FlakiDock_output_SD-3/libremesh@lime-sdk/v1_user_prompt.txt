Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM debian:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install subversion build-essential libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk git ccache gettext libssl-dev xsltproc wget unzip python time -y

ADD . /app

WORKDIR /app

ENTRYPOINT ["/app/cooker"]
CMD ["--help"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [2/4] RUN apt-get update && apt-get install subversion build-essential libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk git ccache gettext libssl-dev xsltproc wget unzip python time -y:
Building dependency tree...
Reading state information...
Package python is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
However the following packages replace it:
  python-is-python3 2to3
E: Package 'python' has no installation candidate
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c apt-get update && apt-get install subversion build-essential libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk git ccache gettext libssl-dev xsltproc wget unzip python time -y" did not complete successfully: exit code: 100```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
