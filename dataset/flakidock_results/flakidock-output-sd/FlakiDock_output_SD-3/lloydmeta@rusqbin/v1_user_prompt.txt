Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ekidd/rust-musl-builder as builder

USER rust

COPY . /home/rust/src

# Need to have the rust user own our copied source files
RUN sudo chown -R rust . &&\
    cargo build --release --verbose

FROM alpine

ARG VCS_REF
ARG CA_CERT
ARG BUILD_DATE

LABEL org.label-schema.vcs-ref=$VCS_REF \
      org.label-schema.vcs-url="https://github.com/lloydmeta/rusqbin" \
      org.label-schema.build-date=$BUILD_DATE

COPY $CA_CERT /etc/ssl/certs/
COPY --from=builder /home/rust/src/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/rusqbin /rusqbin
COPY entry.sh /entry.sh

RUN addgroup -S rusqbinuser &&\
    adduser -S -g rusqbinuser rusqbinuser &&\
    chown -R rusqbinuser /etc/ssl/certs/ &&\
    chown rusqbinuser /rusqbin &&\
    chown rusqbinuser /entry.sh

USER rusqbinuser

EXPOSE 9999

ENTRYPOINT ["/entry.sh", "/rusqbin"]```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
