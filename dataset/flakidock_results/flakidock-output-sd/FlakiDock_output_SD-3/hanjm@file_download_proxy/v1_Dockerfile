The build error indicates that the Go code is using features that are not available in the Go version specified in the Dockerfile (Go 1.8.4). The `io.NopCloser`, `io.Discard`, and `io.ReadAll` functions, as well as the `http.NewResponseController` method, were introduced in later versions of Go. To fix this, we need to update the Go version in the Dockerfile to a more recent version that includes these features.

Here is the repaired Dockerfile:

RUN apk -U add lsof git aria2

ENV GOPATH=/go
