Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:3.10-alpine

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install pipenv && pipenv install --dev

CMD ["pipenv", "run", "pytest"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [4/4] RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install pipenv && pipenv install --dev:
42.01 [pipenv.exceptions.InstallError]: note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
