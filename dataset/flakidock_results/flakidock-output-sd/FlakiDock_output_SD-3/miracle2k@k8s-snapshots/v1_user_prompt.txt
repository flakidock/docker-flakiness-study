Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:3.9-alpine

ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build_deps gcc musl-dev libffi-dev
RUN pip3 install poetry
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false
RUN poetry install --no-dev
RUN apk del .build_deps gcc musl-dev libffi-dev

ENV TZ UTC

CMD ["python", "-m", "k8s_snapshots"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [7/8] RUN poetry install --no-dev:
  AttributeError: cython_sources

      162│ 
      163│             if error is not None:

      167│ 
      168│     def _prepare_sdist(self, archive: Path, destination: Path | None = None) -> Path:
Note: This error originates from the build backend, and is likely not a problem with poetry but with pyyaml (6.0) not supporting PEP 517 builds. You can verify this by running 'pip wheel --no-cache-dir --use-pep517 "pyyaml (==6.0)"'.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c poetry install --no-dev" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
