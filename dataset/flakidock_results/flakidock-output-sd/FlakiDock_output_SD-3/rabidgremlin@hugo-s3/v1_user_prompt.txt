Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ubuntu:xenial
# Hugo install sequence based on Dockerfile from https://bitbucket.org/fmanco/docker-images

# Upgrade
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade -u && apt-get clean

# Install git and ssh client to retrieve sources
RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends openssh-client git

# Install hugo
ENV hugo_deb_url=https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.26/hugo_0.26_Linux-64bit.deb
ADD ${hugo_deb_url} /tmp/hugo.deb
RUN dpkg -i /tmp/hugo.deb && rm -f /tmp/hugo.deb

# install AWS CLI and pygments
RUN apt-get -y install python-pip && \
    pip install awscli && \
    pip install pygments

COPY hugo-s3.sh /
RUN chmod +x /hugo-s3.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/hugo-s3.sh"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [6/8] RUN apt-get -y install python-pip &&     pip install awscli &&     pip install pygments:
    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

      File "/tmp/pip-build-PFpDaI/PyYAML/setup.py", line 68, in <module>
        import sys, os, os.path, pathlib, platform, shutil, tempfile, warnings
    ImportError: No module named pathlib
    
    ----------------------------------------
Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-PFpDaI/PyYAML/
You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c apt-get -y install python-pip &&     pip install awscli &&     pip install pygments" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
