Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM golang:1.11-alpine

# Prepare dependencies
RUN apk add -U git

ENV GO111MODULES=auto

# Include sources
COPY . /go/src/github.com/kocircuit/kocircuit/

# Build ko
RUN \
    go get github.com/golang/protobuf/proto && \
    go get github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go/descriptor && \
    go build -o /go/bin/ko github.com/kocircuit/kocircuit/lang/ko

# Package ko container
FROM alpine

ENV GOPATH=/ko
WORKDIR $GOPATH

# Copy binary
COPY --from=0 /go/bin/ko /usr/bin/

# Copy library sources
COPY ./lib/ /ko/src/github.com/kocircuit/kocircuit/lib/

ENTRYPOINT [ "/usr/bin/ko" ]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [stage-0 4/4] RUN     go get github.com/golang/protobuf/proto &&     go get github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go/descriptor &&     go build -o /go/bin/ko github.com/kocircuit/kocircuit/lang/ko:
package embed: unrecognized import path "embed" (import path does not begin with hostname)
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c go get github.com/golang/protobuf/proto &&     go get github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go/descriptor &&     go build -o /go/bin/ko github.com/kocircuit/kocircuit/lang/ko" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
