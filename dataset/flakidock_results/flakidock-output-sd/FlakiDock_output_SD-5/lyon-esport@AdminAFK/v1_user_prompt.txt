Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM php:7.0-apache

LABEL maintainer="Ludovic Ortega ludovic.ortega@lyon-esport.fr"

# update packages
RUN apt-get update

# install required packages
RUN apt-get -y install curl

# install apache extensions
RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo_mysql

# cleanhtml directory
RUN rm -Rf /var/www/html/*

# copy file to /var/www/html/
COPY . /var/www/html/

# set workdir
WORKDIR /var/www/html/

# remove useless file
RUN rm adminafk.sql server.csv team.csv
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
