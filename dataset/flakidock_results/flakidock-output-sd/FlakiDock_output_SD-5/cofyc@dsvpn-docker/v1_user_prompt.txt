Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```ARG GIT_REF=master
FROM k8s.gcr.io/debian-base:v1.0.0 as builder

WORKDIR /dsvpn

RUN set -x \
    && clean-install clang git ca-certificates make \
    && git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/jedisct1/dsvpn /dsvpn  \
    && git checkout ${GIT_REF} && make

# For security, we use kubernetes community maintained debian base image.
# https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/build/debian-base/
FROM k8s.gcr.io/debian-base:v1.0.0

COPY --from=builder /dsvpn/dsvpn /usr/local/bin/dsvpn

# Keep packages up to date and install packages for our needs.
RUN set -x \
    && apt-get update \
    && apt-get upgrade -y \
    && clean-install \
    util-linux \
    iptables \
    net-tools \
    procps \
    iproute2

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/dsvpn"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
