Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM rust:1.34 as build

WORKDIR /usr/src/gltf-viewer
COPY src src
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.toml
COPY Cargo.lock Cargo.lock
RUN cargo build --release

FROM debian:stretch-20190326-slim
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y \
    xvfb \
    libxcursor1 \
    libxrandr2 \
    libxi6

COPY --from=build /usr/src/gltf-viewer/target/release/gltf-viewer /bin/gltf-viewer
COPY run_xvfb.sh run_xvfb.sh
ENTRYPOINT [ "./run_xvfb.sh" ]

# Hint: To try 'real' headless rendering,
# toggle comments on the previous and following block and use the `--headless` parameter
# RUN apt-get install -y libosmesa6-dev
# ENTRYPOINT [ "gltf-viewer" ]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
