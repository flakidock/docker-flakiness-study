Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:6

# this method installs but requires a new shell to use it - not sure how to do that with docker
#RUN curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash

RUN curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
RUN echo "deb http://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y yarn net-tools

RUN mkdir -p /code
WORKDIR /code
ADD ./package.json package.json

# set the location of yarn-cache so we can mount it as a volume in docker-compose to benefit from yarn's caching
# an to prevent having to rebuild this image
RUN yarn config set cache-folder /root/yarn-cache

# do all new package installs and updates from the yarn container with "docker-compose run yarn"
# we don't want to run yarn here because it makes the image larger than necessary and any change to package.json would rebuild the image
# to prevent this we mount yarn-cache as a docker-compose volume and use yarn.lock to take advantage of all that yarn has to offer
# this means you have to run "docker-compose run yarn" before running "docker-compose up" for the first time
# RUN yarn

ENV DOCKER 1
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
