Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.5.3

RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential

# Update time zone
RUN ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Sao_Paulo /etc/localtime
RUN dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive tzdata

# for a JS runtime
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs

# for mysql
RUN apt-get install -y mysql-client default-libmysqlclient-dev

# for nokogiri
RUN apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev

# for pdftohtml
RUN apt-get install -y -q --no-install-recommends poppler-utils

# add app directory
ENV APP_HOME /ir_investidor
RUN mkdir $APP_HOME
WORKDIR $APP_HOME

# bundle gems in a separate volume
ENV BUNDLE_GEMFILE=$APP_HOME/Gemfile BUNDLE_JOBS="$(nproc)" BUNDLE_PATH=/bundle

# Add application binaries paths to PATH
ENV PATH $APP_HOME/bin:$BUNDLE_PATH/bin:$PATH

ADD . $APP_HOME
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
