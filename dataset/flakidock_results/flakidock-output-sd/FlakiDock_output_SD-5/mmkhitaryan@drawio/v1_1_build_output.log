   1 | >>> The build error indicates that the Go code is using features that are not available in Go 1.13.4. Specifically, the `io.NopCloser`, `io.Discard`, and `io.ReadAll` functions, as well as the `tls.Conn.HandshakeContext` method, were introduced in later versions of Go. To fix this, we need to update the Go version in the Dockerfile to a version that supports these features.
   2 |     
   3 |     Let's update the Go version to a more recent one, such as Go 1.16, which includes these features.
