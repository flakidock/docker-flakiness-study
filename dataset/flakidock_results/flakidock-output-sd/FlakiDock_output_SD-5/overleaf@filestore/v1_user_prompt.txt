Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# This file was auto-generated, do not edit it directly.
# Instead run bin/update_build_scripts from
# https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex-dev-environment

FROM node:12.22.3 as base

WORKDIR /app
COPY install_deps.sh /app
RUN chmod 0755 ./install_deps.sh && ./install_deps.sh

FROM base as app

#wildcard as some files may not be in all repos
COPY package*.json npm-shrink*.json /app/

RUN npm ci --quiet

COPY . /app

FROM base

COPY --from=app /app /app
RUN mkdir -p uploads user_files template_files \
&&  chown node:node uploads user_files template_files
USER node

CMD ["node", "--expose-gc", "app.js"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
