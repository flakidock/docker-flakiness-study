Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ubuntu:bionic

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y \
    golang \
    git \
    libsdl2-dev \
    libsdl2-image-dev \
    libsdl2-mixer-dev \
    libsdl2-ttf-dev \
    libsdl2-gfx-dev

RUN mkdir -p /root/go/src/github.com/blackchip-org/retro-cs
RUN go get github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl
RUN go get github.com/chzyer/readline
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [5/6] RUN go get github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl:
# github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl
root/go/src/github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl/pixels.go:962:34: expected ';', found 'IDENT' b11

ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c go get github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl" did not complete successfully: exit code: 2```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
