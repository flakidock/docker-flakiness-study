Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.3

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        nodejs \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

RUN mkdir -p runner
WORKDIR /usr/src/app/runner
COPY runner/Gemfile* ./
RUN bundle install

RUN mkdir -p configurator
WORKDIR /usr/src/app/configurator
COPY configurator/Gemfile* ./
RUN bundle install

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . .

# WORKDIR /usr/src/app/runner
# RUN bundle exec rake assets:precompile

# WORKDIR /usr/src/app/configurator
# RUN bundle exec rake assets:precompile

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
EXPOSE 80 8080
CMD "./start.sh"
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
