Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM debian
MAINTAINER Neil Chambers <n3llyb0y.uk@gmail.com>

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat

ADD wait /wait

CMD ["/wait"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [2/3] RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat:
Get:6 http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security/main amd64 Packages [169 kB]
Reading state information...
Package netcat is a virtual package provided by:
  netcat-openbsd 1.219-1
  netcat-traditional 1.10-47
E: Package 'netcat' has no installation candidate
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat" did not complete successfully: exit code: 100```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
