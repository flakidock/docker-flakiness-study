Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:carbon

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY src/package*.json ./

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y mysql-client default-libmysqlclient-dev mysql-common


RUN npm install && npm install js-yaml
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm install --only=production

# Bundle app source
COPY src/ .
COPY config.yml .
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 3306
CMD [ "node", "bittrex_listener.js" ]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
