Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:11

RUN mkdir -p /tmp
WORKDIR /tmp/client

## Run these together otherwise we have to remember to run it with --no-cache
#  occasionally
RUN apt update && \
      apt install -y git build-essential


RUN apt autoremove -y

# RUN git clone https://github.com/minimalchat/client.git /tmp/client
COPY . .

ENV REMOTE_HOST "localhost:8000"

# ENV DIGITAL_OCEAN_SPACES_KEY
# ENV CLIENT_KEY


# TODO: Is this the best way to go about supplying the theme details?
# ENV CLIENT_THEME_PRIMARY_COLOUR

# Build the scripts
RUN make dependencies

CMD ["make", "compile"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
