Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:6
# replace this with your application's default port
EXPOSE 8080
# docker build -t snorpy_app .
# docker run -p 8080:8080 -it --rm --name snorpy_container snorpy_app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install p7zip-full wget

RUN useradd -m --user-group -p $(echo SOMEPASSWORDHERE | openssl passwd -1 -stdin) snorpy

RUN git clone https://github.com/chrisjd20/Snorpy.git /opt/snorpy

RUN 7z x /opt/snorpy/node_modules.zip -o/opt/snorpy/

RUN chown snorpy:snorpy /opt/snorpy -R

USER snorpy
WORKDIR /opt/snorpy
ENTRYPOINT ["node","/opt/snorpy/app.js"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
