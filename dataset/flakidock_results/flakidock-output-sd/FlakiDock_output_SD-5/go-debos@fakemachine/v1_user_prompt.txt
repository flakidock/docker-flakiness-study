Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM debian:stretch-slim

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

ENV HOME=/scratch

# Always install procps in case the docker file gets used in jenkins
RUN apt update && apt-get install  --no-install-recommends -y procps

# Bits needed to run fakemachine
RUN apt-get update  && \
    apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y qemu-system-x86 \
                                               qemu-user-static \
                                               busybox \
                                               linux-image-amd64 \
                                               systemd \
                                               dbus

# Bits needed to build fakemachine
RUN apt-get update  && \
    apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y golang-go git ca-certificates

WORKDIR /scratch
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content
