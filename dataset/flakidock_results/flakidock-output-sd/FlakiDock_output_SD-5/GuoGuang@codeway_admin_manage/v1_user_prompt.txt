Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:8.12-alpine as builder
RUN apk add g++ make python
WORKDIR '/app'
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm i node-sass --sass_binary_site=https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/node-sass/
RUN npm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org install
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build:prod

FROM nginx
EXPOSE 9527
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [builder 6/9] RUN npm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org install:
HTTP error 404 Not Found
Hint: If github.com is not accessible in your location
      try setting a proxy via HTTP_PROXY, e.g. 
      export HTTP_PROXY=http://example.com:1234
or configure npm proxy via
      npm config set proxy http://example.com:8080
npm ERR! code CERT_HAS_EXPIRED
npm ERR! errno CERT_HAS_EXPIRED

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
