Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:3.11-slim as python-base
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    POETRY_HOME="/opt/poetry" \
    POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT=true \
    POETRY_NO_INTERACTION=1 \
    PYSETUP_PATH="/opt/venv" \
    VENV_PATH="/opt/venv/.venv"
ENV PATH="$POETRY_HOME/bin:$VENV_PATH/bin:$PATH"

FROM python-base as builder-base
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl build-essential gcc libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev libxslt-dev gcc libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libwebp-dev
# rustc is needed to compile Python packages
RUN curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | bash -s -- -y
ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"
RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - 
WORKDIR $PYSETUP_PATH
COPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml ./
RUN poetry install --only main

FROM python-base as production
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libjpeg-dev libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
RUN groupadd --gid 1000 microblogpub \
  && useradd --uid 1000 --gid microblogpub --shell /bin/bash microblogpub
COPY --from=builder-base $PYSETUP_PATH $PYSETUP_PATH
COPY . /app/
RUN chown -R 1000:1000 /app
USER microblogpub
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["./misc/docker_start.sh"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [builder-base 7/7] RUN poetry install --only main:

      168│     def _prepare_sdist(self, archive: Path, destination: Path | None = None) -> Path:
Note: This error originates from the build backend, and is likely not a problem with poetry but with pyyaml (6.0) not supporting PEP 517 builds. You can verify this by running 'pip wheel --no-cache-dir --use-pep517 "pyyaml (==6.0)"'.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c poetry install --only main" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
