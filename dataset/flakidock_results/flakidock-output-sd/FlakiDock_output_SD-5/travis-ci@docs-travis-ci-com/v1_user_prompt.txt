Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.6.3-slim
LABEL maintainer Travis CI GmbH <support+docs-docker-images@travis-ci.com>

# packages required for bundle install
RUN ( \
   apt-get update ; \
   apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git make gcc g++ libpq-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev curl \
   && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
)

# ------
# Set the encoding to UTF-8
ENV LC_ALL C.UTF-8
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANGUAGE en_US.UTF-8
# -----
ENV WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD_GIST_ID 4e317d6e71be6d0278be46bb751b2f78

# throw errors if Gemfile has been modified since Gemfile.lock
RUN bundle config --global frozen 1
RUN mkdir -p /app

WORKDIR /app
COPY Gemfile      /app
COPY Gemfile.lock /app

RUN gem install bundler
RUN bundler install --verbose --retry=3
RUN gem install --user-install executable-hooks

COPY . /app
RUN bundle exec rake build
COPY . /app

CMD bundle exec puma -p 4000
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [ 8/13] RUN gem install bundler:
ERROR:  Error installing bundler:
	The last version of bundler (>= 0) to support your Ruby & RubyGems was 2.4.22. Try installing it with `gem install bundler -v 2.4.22`
	bundler requires Ruby version >= 3.0.0. The current ruby version is 2.6.3.62.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c gem install bundler" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
