Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:14.3.0-alpine

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "/usr/local/bin/graphql-faker"]
WORKDIR /workdir

EXPOSE 9002

RUN yarn global add graphql-faker && \
    yarn cache clean --force
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Because of the V8 engine whims, feature detection in old core-js versions could cause a slowdown up to 100x even if nothing is polyfilled. Some versions have web compatibility issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
