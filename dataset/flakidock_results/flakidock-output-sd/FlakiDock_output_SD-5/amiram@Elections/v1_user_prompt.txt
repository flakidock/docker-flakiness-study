Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM coreos/apache
MAINTAINER Yonah Russ
COPY Source /var/www/

```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [internal] load metadata for docker.io/coreos/apache:latest:
ERROR: pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: server message: insufficient_scope: authorization failed```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
