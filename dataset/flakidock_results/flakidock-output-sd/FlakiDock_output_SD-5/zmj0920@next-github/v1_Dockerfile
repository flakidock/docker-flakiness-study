The build error indicates that the certificate for the npm registry at "https://registry.npm.taobao.org/" has expired. To fix this, we can switch to the default npm registry or another reliable registry.

Here is the repaired Dockerfile:


FROM mhart/alpine-node:9

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

RUN rm -f package-lock.json \
    ; rm -rf .idea \
    ; rm -rf node_modules \
    ; npm config set registry "https://registry.npmjs.org/" \
    && npm install

EXPOSE 3001
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
