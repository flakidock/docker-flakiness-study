Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:6

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json /app
RUN npm install
COPY . /app

EXPOSE 3000
CMD npm start
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [4/5] RUN npm install:
npm ERR! Linux 3.10.0-1127.10.1.el7.x86_64

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
