Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:7.10

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . /usr/src/app

RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [5/5] RUN npm install:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
