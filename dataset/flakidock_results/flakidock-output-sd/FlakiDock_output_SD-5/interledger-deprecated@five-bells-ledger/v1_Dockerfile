The build error indicates that there is an issue with the npm install command, which is likely due to the outdated Node.js and npm versions. Updating the Node.js version to a more recent LTS version should resolve the issue.

Here is the repaired Dockerfile:


FROM node:14

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . /usr/src/app

RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
