Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# Use the official Docker images
# https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/node/
#
FROM node:9.3.0-stretch

RUN apt-get update

RUN apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev

RUN pip3 install --upgrade cffi
RUN pip3 install httpbin gunicorn


RUN npm install crawler -g
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
