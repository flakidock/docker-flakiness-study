Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```#
# Pushpin Dockerfile
#
# https://github.com/fanout/docker-pushpin
#

# Pull the base image
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Add private APT repository

  apt-get install -y apt-transport-https software-properties-common && \

ENV PUSHPIN_VERSION 1.36.0-1~jammy

# Install Pushpin

  apt-get install -y pushpin=$PUSHPIN_VERSION

# Cleanup

# Add entrypoint script

# Define default entrypoint and command

# Expose ports.

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
