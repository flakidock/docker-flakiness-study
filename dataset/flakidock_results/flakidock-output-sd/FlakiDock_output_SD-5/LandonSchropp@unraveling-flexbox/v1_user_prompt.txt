Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.6.1

# Install Node.js
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install the gems
ADD Gemfile Gemfile.lock .ruby-version /app/
WORKDIR /app
RUN bundle install

# Mount the app
VOLUME /app

# Start the app
EXPOSE 4567
CMD bundle exec middleman
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [2/5] RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs:

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
