Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM rocker/tidyverse:3.6.2

RUN install2.r --error \
    zeallot \
 && rm -rf /tmp/downloaded_packages/
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [2/2] RUN install2.r --error     zeallot  && rm -rf /tmp/downloaded_packages/:
Warning: unable to access index for repository https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2020-02-28/src/contrib:
  cannot open URL 'https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2020-02-28/src/contrib/PACKAGES'
Error: package ‘zeallot’ is not available (for R version 3.6.2)
In addition: Warning message:
package ‘zeallot’ is not available (for R version 3.6.2) 
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c install2.r --error     zeallot  && rm -rf /tmp/downloaded_packages/" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
