Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```# Elixir 1.4: https://hub.docker.com/_/elixir/
FROM elixir:1.4.5
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install hex
RUN mix local.hex --force

# Install rebar
RUN mix local.rebar --force

# Install the Phoenix framework itself
RUN mix archive.install https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/raw/master/phx_new.ez --force

# Install NodeJS 6.x and the NPM
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | bash -
RUN apt-get install -y -q nodejs

# Install inotify for live reload
RUN apt-get install inotify-tools -y

# Set /app as workdir
RUN mkdir /app
ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Install phoenix dependencies
RUN mix deps.get

# Install node dependecies
RUN cd assets/ && npm install -g yarn && yarn install && cd ..
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

06:50:[error] SSL: :hello: ssl_alert.erl:88:Fatal error: internal error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided. To solve the problem, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
