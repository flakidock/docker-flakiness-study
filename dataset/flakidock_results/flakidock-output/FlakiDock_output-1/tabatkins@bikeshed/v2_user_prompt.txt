Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM python:3.9-bullseye as base

# Get the latest spec-data, then cache it so we don't have to redo this on every rebuild
from base as specdata
RUN mkdir /bikeshed-master
WORKDIR /bikeshed-master
RUN git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git /bikeshed-master
RUN pip install --editable /bikeshed-master
RUN bikeshed update

FROM base as builder
RUN mkdir /install
WORKDIR /install

COPY requirements.txt /requirements.txt
RUN pip install --prefix=/install -r /requirements.txt

FROM base
RUN mkdir -p /app/bikeshed
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /install /usr/local
COPY --from=specdata /bikeshed-master/bikeshed/spec-data /app/bikeshed/spec-data

# setup.py opens README.md, semver.txt and requirements.txt so they must be copied.
COPY setup.py README.md semver.txt requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install --editable .

COPY .git /app/.git
COPY bikeshed.py /app/
COPY bikeshed /app/bikeshed
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [specdata 3/5] RUN git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git /bikeshed-master:

Below are a few false repairs that an LLM previously made by mistake for the input flaky Dockerfile along with their build outputs as further demonstrations. These examples are provided to help you understand the task better and to avoid making the same mistakes. So, do not generate the exact false repair generated previously, but you can get ideas from them.

# False Repair 1
## False Repair Dockerfile
```The build error indicates that the branch `master` does not exist in the repository `https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git`. This is likely because the default branch name has been changed from `master` to `main`. To fix this, we need to update the branch name in the `git clone` command.

Here is the repaired Dockerfile:


FROM python:3.9-bullseye as base

# Get the latest spec-data, then cache it so we don't have to redo this on every rebuild
FROM base as specdata
RUN mkdir /bikeshed-master
WORKDIR /bikeshed-master
RUN git clone --depth=1 --branch=main https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git /bikeshed-master
RUN pip install --editable /bikeshed-master
RUN bikeshed update

FROM base as builder
RUN mkdir /install
WORKDIR /install

COPY requirements.txt /requirements.txt
RUN pip install --prefix=/install -r /requirements.txt

FROM base
RUN mkdir -p /app/bikeshed
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /install /usr/local
COPY --from=specdata /bikeshed-master/bikeshed/spec-data /app/bikeshed/spec-data

# setup.py opens README.md, semver.txt and requirements.txt so they must be copied.
COPY setup.py README.md semver.txt requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install --editable .

COPY .git /app/.git
COPY bikeshed.py /app/
COPY bikeshed /app/bikeshed```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided alongside the examples provided for you for as demonstrations. To solve the problem, and based on the information provided, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
