Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.1.4
MAINTAINER Steven Jack <stevenmajack@gmail.com>

RUN mkdir -p /var/data/fake-s3 /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

RUN gem install fakes3

EXPOSE 4569

ENTRYPOINT ["fakes3", "-r" ,"/var/data/fake-s3", "-p", "4569"]

```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [4/4] RUN gem install fakes3:
ERROR:  Error installing fakes3:
	thor requires Ruby version >= 2.6.0.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c gem install fakes3" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Below are a few examples of dockerfiles and their build errors alongside their repairs. These examples are provided to help you understand the task better.

# Example 1
## Example Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.7.5-alpine3.15

RUN apk add --no-cache build-base

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock /usr/src/app/deliveroo.engineering/
WORKDIR /usr/src/app/deliveroo.engineering
RUN gem install bundler && bundle install -j8

EXPOSE 4000
ENTRYPOINT ["jekyll"]
CMD ["serve", "-w", "-t", "-H", "0.0.0.0"]

```

## Example Build Error
```> [5/5] RUN gem install bundler && bundle install -j8:
ERROR:  Error installing bundler:
	The last version of bundler (>= 0) to support your Ruby & RubyGems was 2.4.22. Try installing it with `gem install bundler -v 2.4.22`
	bundler requires Ruby version >= 3.0.0. The current ruby version is 2.7.5.203.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c gem install bundler && bundle install -j8" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

## Example Repair

### Repair 1
```FROM ruby:2.7.5-alpine3.15

RUN apk add --no-cache build-base

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock /usr/src/app/deliveroo.engineering/
WORKDIR /usr/src/app/deliveroo.engineering
RUN gem install bundler -v 2.4.22 && bundle install -j8

EXPOSE 4000
ENTRYPOINT ["jekyll"]
CMD ["serve", "-w", "-t", "-H", "0.0.0.0"]

```


# Example 2
## Example Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.7.7

RUN apt-get install -y nodejs

ENV BUNDLE_PATH /box

ENV APP_HOME /app
RUN mkdir $APP_HOME
WORKDIR $APP_HOME

ADD . $APP_HOME

CMD script/server

```

## Example Build Error
```> [3/9] RUN gem update --system:
ERROR:  Error installing rubygems-update:
	There are no versions of rubygems-update (= 3.5.1) compatible with your Ruby & RubyGems
	rubygems-update requires Ruby version >= 3.0.0. The current ruby version is 2.7.7.221.

## Example Repair

### Repair 1

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided alongside the examples provided for you for as demonstrations. To solve the problem, and based on the information provided, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content
