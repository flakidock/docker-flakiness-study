Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
# Update APT
RUN apt-get update
# We need timezone for tk, so do that here
RUN apt-get install -y tzdata
# Set the timezone
RUN ln -fs /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime
RUN dpkg-reconfigure --frontend noninteractive tzdata
RUN apt-get install -y \
    python3 \ 
    python3-pip \
    python3-setuptools \
    python3-tk
COPY . /
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python3", "xtree_plan.py"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [9/9] RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt:
error: externally-managed-environment
× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.
    
    See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information.
note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.

Below are a few examples of dockerfiles and their build errors alongside their repairs. These examples are provided to help you understand the task better.

# Example 1
## Example Dockerfile
```FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add --update python3 py3-pip git tcpdump

RUN git clone https://github.com/649/Memcrashed-DDoS-Exploit.git Memcrashed
WORKDIR Memcrashed
# COPY requirements.txt .
# COPY api.txt .
# COPY bots.txt .
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "Memcrashed.py"]

```

## Example Build Error
```> [5/5] RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt:
error: externally-managed-environment
× This environment is externally managed
╰─> 
    The system-wide python installation should be maintained using the system
    package manager (apk) only.
    
    If the package in question is not packaged already (and hence installable via
    "apk add py3-somepackage"), please consider installing it inside a virtual
    environment, e.g.:
    
    python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
    . /path/to/venv/bin/activate
    pip install mypackage
    
    To exit the virtual environment, run:
    
    deactivate
    
    The virtual environment is not deleted, and can be re-entered by re-sourcing
    the activate file.
    
    To automatically manage virtual environments, consider using pipx (from the
    pipx package).
note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

## Example Repair

### Repair 1
```FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add --update python3 py3-pip git tcpdump

RUN git clone https://github.com/649/Memcrashed-DDoS-Exploit.git Memcrashed
WORKDIR Memcrashed
# COPY requirements.txt .
# COPY api.txt .

RUN python3 -m venv venv
RUN . venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt

ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "Memcrashed.py"]```


### Repair 2
```FROM alpine:latest

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided alongside the examples provided for you for as demonstrations. To solve the problem, and based on the information provided, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
