Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM alpine:latest
ENV TZ Europe/Berlin

WORKDIR /srv

RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache bash \
    tzdata less python3 curl mlocate groff openssl

RUN curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py \
    && python3 get-pip.py \
    && rm -f get-pip.py

RUN cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime && echo $TZ > /etc/timezone
RUN pip install awscli --upgrade
RUN curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.17.17/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl \
    && chmod +x kubectl && mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl \
    && mkdir -p /root/.kube
VOLUME ["/root/.kube"]

COPY k8s-backup.sh /usr/local/bin/k8s-backup.sh
RUN  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/k8s-backup.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["k8s-backup.sh"]
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [4/9] RUN curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py     && python3 get-pip.py     && rm -f get-pip.py:

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> 
    The system-wide python installation should be maintained using the system
    package manager (apk) only.
    
    If the package in question is not packaged already (and hence installable via
    "apk add py3-somepackage"), please consider installing it inside a virtual
    environment, e.g.:
    
    python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
    . /path/to/venv/bin/activate
    pip install mypackage
    
    To exit the virtual environment, run:
    
    deactivate
    
    The virtual environment is not deleted, and can be re-entered by re-sourcing
    the activate file.
    
    To automatically manage virtual environments, consider using pipx (from the
    pipx package).
note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

Below are a few examples of dockerfiles and their build errors alongside their repairs. These examples are provided to help you understand the task better.

# Example 1
## Example Dockerfile

RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip
RUN pip3 install textX
ADD . /src
WORKDIR /src
RUN pip3 install -v .
EXPOSE 4433/UDP
CMD ["qvalve"]

```

## Example Repair

### Repair 1
```FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip

ENV VIRTUAL_ENV=/venv
ENV PATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin:$PATH"
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install textX
ADD . /src
WORKDIR /src
RUN pip install -v .
EXPOSE 4433/UDP
CMD ["qvalve"]

```


### Repair 2
```FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip
RUN rm /usr/lib/python*/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED && \
    python3 -m ensurepip
RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip
RUN pip3 install textX
ADD . /src
WORKDIR /src
RUN pip3 install -v .
EXPOSE 4433/UDP
CMD ["qvalve"]

```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided alongside the examples provided for you for as demonstrations. To solve the problem, and based on the information provided, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
