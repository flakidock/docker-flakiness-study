The build error indicates that there is an issue with the specific version of Node.js and npm being used. The error `ENOTDIR: not a directory` often occurs due to issues with the npm version or the way dependencies are being handled. Updating the Node.js and npm versions to more recent and stable versions can resolve this issue.

Here is the repaired Dockerfile:


FROM node:14

# Install location
ENV dir /opt/ldf-client

# Copy the client files
ADD . ${dir}

# Install the node module
WORKDIR ${dir}
RUN npm install

# Run base binary
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "bin/ldf-client"]

# Default command
CMD ["--help"]
