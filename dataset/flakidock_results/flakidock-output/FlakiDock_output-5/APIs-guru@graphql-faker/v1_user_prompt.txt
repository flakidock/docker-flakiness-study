Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM node:14.3.0-alpine

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "/usr/local/bin/graphql-faker"]
WORKDIR /workdir

EXPOSE 9002

RUN yarn global add graphql-faker && \
    yarn cache clean --force
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided alongside the examples provided for you for as demonstrations. To solve the problem, and based on the information provided, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
    <<<<<
    Dockerfile content 
    >>>>>
