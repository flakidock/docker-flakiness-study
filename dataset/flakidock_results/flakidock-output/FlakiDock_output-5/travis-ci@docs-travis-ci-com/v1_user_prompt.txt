Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.6.3-slim
LABEL maintainer Travis CI GmbH <support+docs-docker-images@travis-ci.com>

# packages required for bundle install
RUN ( \
   apt-get update ; \
   apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git make gcc g++ libpq-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev curl \
   && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
)

RUN bundle config --global frozen 1
RUN mkdir -p /app

WORKDIR /app
COPY Gemfile      /app

RUN gem install bundler
RUN bundler install --verbose --retry=3
RUN gem install --user-install executable-hooks

COPY . /app
RUN bundle exec rake build
COPY . /app

CMD bundle exec puma -p 4000
```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [ 8/13] RUN gem install bundler:
ERROR:  Error installing bundler:
	The last version of bundler (>= 0) to support your Ruby & RubyGems was 2.4.22. Try installing it with `gem install bundler -v 2.4.22`
	bundler requires Ruby version >= 3.0.0. The current ruby version is 2.6.3.62.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c gem install bundler" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Below are a few examples of dockerfiles and their build errors alongside their repairs. These examples are provided to help you understand the task better.

# Example 1
## Example Dockerfile
```FROM ruby:2.7.1
RUN gem install bundler
ENV LANG=C.UTF-8 
ENV WORKDIR=/fir-cli
ENV HOME=/fir-cli
RUN mkdir -p $WORKDIR
ADD ./ $HOME
WORKDIR $WORKDIR
RUN ["bundle", "install"]
RUN ["touch", "README.md"]
RUN ["rake", "install"]
ENTRYPOINT ["fir"]

```

## Example Build Error
```> [2/8] RUN gem install bundler:
ERROR:  Error installing bundler:
	The last version of bundler (>= 0) to support your Ruby & RubyGems was 2.4.22. Try installing it with `gem install bundler -v 2.4.22`
	bundler requires Ruby version >= 3.0.0. The current ruby version is 2.7.1.83.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c gem install bundler" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided alongside the examples provided for you for as demonstrations. To solve the problem, and based on the information provided, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
