Below is the flaky Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile
```ARG IMAGE=ruby:3.1
FROM $IMAGE

RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y -q build-essential autoconf libtool clang lcov clang-tidy libclang-dev python3 python3-pip ccache

RUN gem install bundler --no-doc

```

And below is the build error that occurred when trying to build the Dockerfile:
# Build Error
```> [ 3/21] RUN pip3 install compiledb:
error: externally-managed-environment
× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a

Below are a few examples of dockerfiles and their build errors alongside their repairs. These examples are provided to help you understand the task better.

# Example 1
## Example Dockerfile
```FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip
RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip
RUN pip3 install textX
ADD . /src
WORKDIR /src
RUN pip3 install -v .
EXPOSE 4433/UDP
CMD ["qvalve"]

```

## Example Build Error
```> [3/7] RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip:
error: externally-managed-environment
× This environment is externally managed
╰─> 
    The system-wide python installation should be maintained using the system
    package manager (apk) only.
    
    If the package in question is not packaged already (and hence installable via
    "apk add py3-somepackage"), please consider installing it inside a virtual
    environment, e.g.:
    
    python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
    . /path/to/venv/bin/activate
    pip install mypackage
    
    To exit the virtual environment, run:
    
    deactivate
    
    The virtual environment is not deleted, and can be re-entered by re-sourcing
    the activate file.
    
    To automatically manage virtual environments, consider using pipx (from the
    pipx package).
note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c pip3 install --upgrade pip" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1```

## Example Repair

### Repair 1
```FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip
RUN python3 -m venv /venv
ENV VIRTUAL_ENV=/venv
ENV PATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin:$PATH"
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install textX
ADD . /src
WORKDIR /src
RUN pip install -v .
EXPOSE 4433/UDP
CMD ["qvalve"]

```


### Repair 2
```FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 py3-pip
RUN rm /usr/lib/python*/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED && \
    python3 -m ensurepip
RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip
RUN pip3 install textX
ADD . /src
WORKDIR /src
RUN pip3 install -v .
EXPOSE 4433/UDP
CMD ["qvalve"]

```

Your task is to repair the Dockerfile based on the Dockerfile and its build error provided alongside the examples provided for you for as demonstrations. To solve the problem, and based on the information provided, first, you should diagnose which part is causing the flakiness and why. Then, according to the characteristics of that flakiness, repair the Dockerfile. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
