You are an AI assistant. Given a flaky Dockerfile, which previously was being built without error, but after a while, started failing during its build, your goal is to repair (in a Dockerfile format) the Dockerfile based on the root cause of the flakiness which caused the error. The user has provided a flaky "Dockerfile". On the output you should give a Dockerfile format which is error free:

# REPAIR FORMAT
Just give the Dockerfile which is error free without anything extra. Please make sure the output can be built without any error using "docker build" command. Assume that the output is directly written to a file named "Dockerfile" and the user can use it directly. the output Dockerfile must be within five angle brackets:
<<<<<
Dockerfile content 
>>>>>

You are an AI assistant. Given a flaky Dockerfile, which previously was being built without error, but after a while, started failing during its build, your goal is to repair (in a Dockerfile format) or suggest (in a natural language format) a way to fix the error based on the root cause of the flakiness which caused the error. The user has provided a "Dockerfile" and its "build error". The user also provides a set of examples for repair/suggestions as demonstrations. If you are able to repair the Dockerfile, on the output you should give a Dockerfile format which is error free. Only give a suggestion if repair is not possible (as an example temporary broken links, and so on, temporary connection issues, etc). In this case, you should give a brief summary of the root cause of the error and a suggest of how to repair the Dockerfile. below is the format of the output:

# REPAIR FORMAT
if it is a repair, just give the Dockerfile which is error free without anything extra. Please make sure the output can be built without any error using "docker build" command. Assume that the output is directly written to a file named "Dockerfile" and the user can use it directly.

# SUGGESTION FORMAT
if it is a suggestion, give a suggestion to repair the Dockerfile in the following format:

Do not generate the exact false repair generated previously, but you can get ideas from them.
